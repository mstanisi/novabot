      " i awoke from the sickness at the age of forty-five, calm and sane, and in reasonably good health except for a weakened liver and the look of borrowed flesh common to all who survive. the sickness... most survivors do not remember the delirium in detail. i apparently took detailed notes on sickness and delirium. i have no precise memory of writing the notes which have now been published under the title naked lunch. the title was suggested by jack kerouac. i did not understand what the title meant until my recent recovery. the title means exactly what the words say: naked lunch -- a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork. the sickness is drug addiction and i was an addict for fifteen years. when i say addict i mean an addict to junk (generic term for opium and/or derivatives including all synthetics from demerol to palfium). i have used junk in many forms: morphin, heroin, dilaudid, eukodol, pantopon, diocodid, diosane, opium, demerol, dolophine, palfium. i have smoked junk, sniffed it, injected it in vein-skinmuscle, inserted it in rectal suppositories. the needle is not important. whether you sniff it smoke it eat it or shove it up you ass the result is the same: addiction. when i speak of drug addiction i do not refer to keif, marijuana or any preparation of hashish, mescaline, bannisteria caapi, lsd6, sacred mushrooms or any other drug of the hallucinogen group... there is no evidence that the use of any hallucinogen results in physical dependence. the action of these drugs is physiologically opposite to the action of junk. a lamentable confusion between the two classes of drugs has arisen owing to the zeal of the u.s. and other narcotic departments. i have seen the exact manner in which the junk virus operates through fifteen years of addiction. the pyramid of junk, one level eating the level below (it is no accident that junk higher-ups are always fat and the addict in the street is always thin) right up to the top or tops since there are many junk pyramids feeding on peoples of the world and all built on basic principles of monopoly: never give anything for nothing. never give more than you have to give (always catch the buyer hungry and always make him wait). always take everything back if you possibly can. the pusher always get it all back. the addict needs more and more junk to maintain a human form... buy off the monkey. junk is the mold of monopoly and possession. the addict stands by while his junk legs carry him straight in on the junk beam to relapse. junk is quantitative and accurately mesurable. the more junk you use the less you have and the more you have the more you use. all the hallucinogen drugs are considered sacred by those who use them -- there are peyote cults and bannisteria cults, hashish cults and mushroom cults - \"the sacred mushrooms of mexico enable a man to see god\" -- but no one ever suggested that junk is sacred. there are no opium cults. opium is profane and quantitative like money. i have heard that there was once a beneficent non-habit-forming junk in india. it was called soma and is pictured as a beautiful blue tide. if soma ever existed the pusher was there to bottle it and monopolize it and sell it and it turned into plain old time junk. junk is the ideal product... the ultimate merchandise. no sales talk necessary. the client will crawl through a sewer and beg to buy... the junk merchant does not sell his product to the consumer, he sells the consumer to his product. he does not improve and simplify his merchandise. he degrades and simplifies the client. he pays his staff in junk. junk yields a basic formula of evil virus: the algebra of need. the face of evil is always the face of total need. a dope fiend is a man in total need of dope. beyond a certain frequency need knows absolutely no limit or control. in the words of total need: wouldn’t you? yes you would. you would lie, cheat, inform on your fiends, steal, do anything to satisfy total need. because you would be in a state of total sickness, total possession, and not in a position to act in any other way. dope fiends are sick people who cannot act other than they do. a rabid dog cannot choose but bite. assuming a self-righteous position is nothing to the purpose unless your purpose is to keep the junk virus in operation. and junk is a big industry. i recall talking to an american who worked for the aftosa commission in mexico. six hundred a month plus expense account: \"how long will the epidemic last ?\" i enquired. \"as long as we can keep it going.... and yes... maybe the aftosa will break in south america,\" he said dreamily. if you wish to alter or annihilate a pyramid of numbers in a serial relation, you alter or remove the bottom number. if we wish to annihilate the junk pyramid, we must start with the bottom of the pyramid: the addict in the street, and stop tilting quixotically for the \"higher ups\" so called, all of whom are immediately replaceable. the addict in the street who must have junk to live is the one irreplaceable factor in the junk equation. when there are no more addicts to buy junk there will be no junk trafic. as long as junk need exists, someone will service it. addicts can be cured or quarantined – that is, allowed a morphine ration under minimal supervision like typhoid carriers. when this is done, the junk pyramids of the world will collapse. so far as i know, england is the only country to apply this method to the junk problem. they have about five hundred quarantined addicts in the u.k. in another generation when the quarantined addicts die off and pain killers operating on a non-junk principle will be discovered, the junk virus will be like smallpox, a closed chapter – a medical curiosity. the vaccine that can relegate the junk virus to a land-locked past is in existence. this vaccine is the apomorphine treatment discovered by an english doctor whose name i must withhold pending his permission to use it and to quote from his book covering thirty years of apomorphine treatment of addicts and alcoholics. the compound apomorphine is formed by boiling morphine with hydrochloric acid. it was discovered years before it was used to treat addicts. for many years the only use for apomorphine was an emetic to induce vomiting in cases of poisoning. it acts directly on the vomiting center in the back brain. i found this vaccine at the end of the junk line. i lived in one room in the native quarter of tangier. i had not taken a bath in a year of changed my clothes or removed them except to stick a needle every hour in the fibrous grey wooden flesh of terminal addiction. i never cleaned or dusted the room. empty ampule boxes and garbage piled up to the ceiling. light and water had been long since turned off for non-payment. i did absolutely nothing. i could look at the end of my shoe for eight hours. i was only roused to action when the hourglass of junk ran out. if a friend came to visit - and they rarely did since who or what was left to visit -- i sat there not caring that he had entered my field of vision – a grey screen always blanker and fainter – and not caring when he walked out of it. if he had died on the spot i would have sat there looking at my shoe waiting to go through his pockets. wouldn’t you? because i never had enough junk – no one ever does. thirty grains of morphine a day and it still was not enough. and long waits in front of a drugstore. delay is a rule in the junk business. the man is never on time. this is no accident. there are no accidents in the junk world. the addict is taught again and again exactly what will happen if he does not score for his junk ration. get up that money or else. and suddenly my habit began to jump and jump. forty, sixty grains a day. and it still was not enough. and i could not pay. i stood there with my last check in my hand and realized that it was my last check. i took the next plane to london. the doctor explained to me that apomorphine acts on the back brain to regulate the metabolism and normalize the blood stream in such a way that the enzyme system of addiction is destroyed over a period of four or five days. once the back brain is regulated apomorphine can be discontinued and only used in case of relapse.(no one would take apomorphine for kicks. not one case of addiction to apomorphine has ever been recorded.) i agreed to undergo treatment and entered a nursing home. for the first twenty-four hours i was literally insane and paranoid as many addicts are in severe withdrawal. this delirium was dispersed by twenty-four hours of intensive apomorphine treatment. the doctor showed me the chart. i had received minute amounts of morphine that could not possibly account fort my lack of the more severe withdrawal symptoms such as leg and stomach cramps, fever and my own special symptom, the cold burn, like a vast hives covering the body and rubbed with menthol. every addict has his own special symptom that cracks all control. there was a missing factor in the withdrawal equation – that factor could only be apomorphine. i saw the apomorphine treatment really work. eight days later i left the nursing home eating and sleeping normally. i remained completely off the junk for two full years – a twelve years record. i did relapse for some months as a result of pain and illness. another apomorphine cure has kept me off junk through this writing. the apomorphine cure is qualitatively different from other methods of cure. i have tried them all. short reduction, slow reduction, cortisone, anthihistaminics, tranquillizers, sleeping cures, tolserol, reserpine. none of these cures lasted beyond the first opportunity to relapse. i can say definitely that i was never metabolically cured until i took the apomorphine cure. the overwhelming relapse statistics from the lexington narcotic hospital have led many doctors to say that addiction is not curable. they use a dolophine reduction cure at lexington and have never tried apomorphine as far as i know. in fact, this method of treatment has been largely neglected. no research has been done with variations of the apomorphine formula or with synthetics. no doubt substances fifty times stronger than apomorphine could be developed and the side effect of vomiting eliminated. apomorphine is a metabolic and psychic regulator that can be discontinued as soon as it has done its work. the world is deluged with tranquillizers and energizers but this unique regulator has not received attention. no research has been done by any of the large pharmaceutical companies. i suggest that research with variations of apomorphine and snthesis of it will open a new medical frontier extending far beyond the problem of addiction. the smallpox vaccine was opposed by a vociferous lunatic group of anti-vaccinationists. no doubt a scream of protest will go up from interested or unbalanced individuals as the junk virus is shot out from under them. junk is big business; there are always cranks and operators. they must not be allowed to interfere with the essential work of inoculation treatment and quarantine. the junk virus is public health problem number one of the world today. since naked lunch treats this health problem, it is necessarily brutal, obscene and disgusting. sickness has often repulsive details not for weak stomachs. certain passages in the book that have been called pornographic were written as a tract against capital punishment in the manner of jonathan swift’s modest proposal. these sections are intended to reveal capital punishment as the obscene, barbaric and disgusting anachronism that it is. as always the lunch is naked. if civilized countries want to return to druid hanging rites in the sacred grove or to drink blood with the aztecs and feed their gods with blood of human sacrifice, let them see what they actually eat and drink. let them see what is on the end of that long newspaper spoon. as i write i have almost completed a sequel to naked lunch. a mathematical extension of the algebra of need beyond the junk virus. because there are many forms of addiction i think that they all obey basic laws. in the words of heisenberg: \"this may not be the best of all possible universes but it may well prove to be one of the simplest.\" if man can see. post script... wouldn’t you? and speaking personnally and if a man speaks any other way we might as well start looking for his protoplasm daddy or mother cell... i don’t want to hear any more tired old junk talk and junk con... the same things said a million times and more and there is no point in saying anything because nothing ever happens in the junk world. only excuse for this tired death route is the kick when the junk circuit is cut off for the nonpayment and the junk-skin dies of junk-lack and overdose of time and the old skin has forgotten the skin game simplifying the junk cover the way skins will... a condition of total exposure is precipitated when the kicking addict cannot choose but see smell and listen... watch out for the cars... it is clear that junk is a round-the-world-push-an-opium-pellet-with-your-nose-route. strictly for scarabs – stumble bum junk heap. and as such report to disposal. tired of seeing it around. junkies always beef about the cold as they call it, turning up their black coat collars and clutching their withered necks... pure junk con. a junky does not want to be warm, he wants to be cool-cooler-cold. but he wants the cold like he wants his junk – not outside where it does him no good but inside so he can sit around with a spine like a frozen hydraulic jack... his metabolism approaching absolute zero. terminal addicts often go two months without a bowel move and the intestines make with sit-down-adhesions -–wouldn't you? -- requiring the intervention of an apple corer or its surgical equivalent... such is life in the old ice house. why move around and waste time? room for one more inside, sir. some entities are on thermodynamic kicks. they invented thermodynamics... wouldn’t you? and some of us are on different kicks and that’s a thing out in the open the way i like to see what i eat and vice versa mutatis mutandis as the case may be. bill’s naked lunch room... step right up... good for young and old, man and bestial. nothing like a little snake oil to grease the wheels and get a show on the track jack. which side are you on? fro-zen hydraulic? or you want to take a look around with honest bill? so that’s the world health problem i was talking about back in the article. the prospect before us friends of mine. do i hear muttering about a personal razor and some bush league short con artist who is known to have invented the bill? wouldn’t you? the razor belonged to a man named ockham and he was not a scar collector. ludwig wittgenstein tractatus logicophilosophicus: \"if a proposition is not necessary it is meaningless and approaching meaning zero.\" \"and what is more unnecessary that junk if you don’t need it ?\" answer? \"junkies, if you are not on junk.\" i tell you boys, i’ve heard some tired conversation but no other occupation group can approximate that old thermodynamic junk slow-down. now your heroin addict does not say hardly anything and that i can stand. but your opium \"smoker\" is more active since he still has a tent and a lamp... and maybe 7-9-10 lying up there like hibernating reptiles keep the temperature up to talking level : how low the other junkies are \"whereas we – we have this tent and this lamp and this tent and this lamp and this tent and nice and outside it’s cold... it’s cold outside where the dross eaters and the needle boys won’t last two years not six months hardly won’t last stumble bum around and there is no class in them... but we sit here and never increase the dose... never – never increase the dose never except tonight is a special occasion with all the dross eaters and the needle boys out there in the cold... and we never eat it never never never never eat it... excuse please while i take a trip to the source of living drops they all have in pocket and opium pellets shoved up the ass in a finger stall with the family jewels and the other shit. room for one more inside, sir. well when that record starts around for the billionth light year and never the tape shall change us non-junkies take drastic action and the men separate out from the junk boys. only way to protect yourself against this horrid peril is come over here and shack up with charybdis... treat you right kid... candy and cigarettes. i am after fifteen years in that tent. in and out in and out in and out. over and out. so listen to old uncle bill burroughs who invented the burroughs adding machine regulator gimmick on the hydraulic jack principle no matter how you jerk the handle result is always the same for given coordinates. got my training early... wouldn’t you? paregoric babes of the world unite. we have nothing to lose but our pushers. and they are not necessary. lookd down look down along that junk road before you travel there and get in with the wrong mob... a word to the wise guy. -- william s. burroughs  \f",
      "8  afterthoughts on a deposition  when i say i have no memory of writing naked lunch, this is of course an exaggeration, and it is to be kept in mind that there are various areas of memory. junk is a pain-killer, it also kills the pain and pleasure implicit in awareness. while the factual memory of an addict may be quite accurate and extensive, his emotional memory may be scanty and, in the case of heavy addiction, approaching affective zero. when i say \"the junk virus is public health problem number one of the world today,\" i refer not just to the actual ill effects of opiates upon the individual’s health (which, in cases of controlled dosage may be minimal), but also to the hysteria that drug use often occasions in populaces who are prepared by the media and narcotics officials for a hysterical reaction. the junk problem, in its present form, began with the harrison narcotics act of 1914 in the u.s.a. anti-drug hysteria is now worldwide, and it poses a deadly threat to personal freedoms and due-process protections of the law everywhere.  --william s. burroughs october 1991  \f",

( note: grass is english thief slang for inform.) i drew closer and laid my dirty junky fingers on his sharkskin sleeve. \"and us blood brothers in the same dirty needle, i can tell you in confidence he is due for a hot shot.\"(note: this is a cap of poison junk sold to addict for liquidation purposes. often given to informers. usually the hot shot is strychnine since it tastes and looks like junk.) \"ever see a hot shot hit, kid? i saw the gimp catch one in philly. we rigged his room with a oneway whorehouse mirror and charged a sawski to watch it. he never got the needle out of his arm. they don't if the shot is right. that's the way they find them, dropper full of clotted blood hanging out of a blue arm. the look in his eyes when it hit -- kid, it was tasty.... \"recollect when i am traveling with the vigilante, best shake man in the industry. out in chi...we is working the fags in lincoln park. so one night the vigilante turns up for work in cowboy boots and a black vest with a hunka tin on it and a lariat slung over his shoulder. \"so i says: 'what's with you? you wig already?' \"he just looks at me and says: 'fill your hand stranger' and hauls out an old rusty six shooter and i take off across lincoln park, bullets cutting all around me. and he hangs three fags before the fuzz nail him. i mean the vigilante earned his moniker.... \"ever notice how many expressions carry over from queers to con men? like 'raise,' letting someone know you are in the same line? \" 'get her!' \" 'get the paregoric kid giving that mark the build up!' \" 'eager beaver wooing him much too fast.' \"the shoe store kid (he got that moniker shaking down fetishists in shoe stores) say: 'give it to a mark with k.y. and he will come back moaning for more.' and when the kid spots a mark he begin to breathe heavy. his face swells and his lips turn purple like an eskimo in heat. then slow, slow he comes on the mark, feeling for him, palpating him with fingers of rotten ectoplasm. \"the rube has a sincere little boy look, burns through him like blue neon. that one stepped right off a saturday evening post cover with a string of bullheads, and preserved himself in junk. his marks never beef and the bunko people are really carrying a needle for the rube. one day little  \f",

(note: make in the sense of dig or size up.) i mean he can walk up to a pusher and score direct. he is so anonymous, grey and spectral the pusher don't remember him afterwards. so he twists one after the other.... well the buyer comes to look more and more like a junky. he can't drink. he can't get it up. his teeth fall out. (like pregnant women lose their teeth feeding the stranger, junkies lose their yellow fangs feeding the monkey.) he is all the time sucking on a candy bar. baby ruths he digs special. \"it really disgust you to see the buyer sucking on them candy bars so nasty,\" a cop says. the buyer takes on an ominous grey-green color. fact is his body is making its own junk or equivalent. the buyer has a steady connection. a man within you might say, or so he thinks. \"i'll just set in my room,\" he says. \"fuck 'em all. squares on both sides. i am the only complete man in the industry.\" but a yen comes on him like a great black wind through the bones. so the buyer hunts up a young junky and gives him a paper to make it. \"oh all right,\" the boy says. \"so what you want to make?\" \"i just want to rub up against you and get fixed.\" \"ugh... well all right.... but why cancha just get physical like a human?\" later the boy is sitting in a waldorf with two colleagues dunking pound cake. \"most distasteful thing i ever stand still for,\" he says. \"some way he make himself all soft like a blob of jelly and surround me so nasty. then he gets wet all over like with green slime. so i guess he come to some kinda awful climax.... i come near wigging with that green stuff all over me, and he stink like a old rotten cantaloupe.\" \"well it's still an easy score.\"  \f",
      "15  the boy sighed resignedly; \"yes, i guess you can get used to anything. i've got a meet with him again tomorrow.\" the buyer's habit keeps getting heavier. he needs a recharged every half hour. sometimes he cruises the precincts and bribes the turnkey to let him in with a cell of junkies. it get to where no amount of contact will fix him. at this point he receives a summons from the district supervisor: \"bradley, your conduct has given rise to rumors -- and i hope for your sake they are no more than that -- so unspeakably distasteful that... i mean caesar's wife ...hrump... that is, the department must be above suspicion... certainly above such suspicions as you have seemingly aroused. you are lowering the entire tone of the industry. we are prepared to accept your immediate resignation.\" the buyer throws himself on the ground and crawls over to the d.s. \"no, boss man, no... the department is my very lifeline.\" he kisses the d.s.'s hand thrusting his fingers into his mouth (the d.s. must feel his toothless gums) complaining he has lost his teeth \"inna thervith.\" \"please boss man. i'll wipe your ass, i'll wash out your dirty condoms, i'll polish your shoes with the oil on my nose.... \"really, this is most distasteful11 have you no pride? i must tell you i feel a distinct revulsion. i mean there is something, well, rotten about you, and you smell like a compost heap.\" he put a scented handkerchief in front of his face. \"i must ask you to leave this office at once. \"i'll do anything, boss, anything.\" his ravaged green face splits in a horrible smile. \"i'm still young, boss, and i'm pretty strong when i get my blood up.\" the d.s. retches into his handkerchief and points to the door with a limp hand. the buyer stands up looking at the d.s. dreamily. his body begins to dip like a dowser's wand. he flows forward.... \"no! no!\" screams the d.s. \"schlup... schlup schlup.\" an hour later they find the buyer on the nod in the d.s.'s chair. the d.s. has disappeared without a trace. the judge: \"everything indicates that you have, in some unspeakable manner uh... assimilated the district supervisor. unfortunately there is no proof. i would recommend that you be confined or more accurately contained in some institution, but i know of no place suitable for a man of your caliber. i must reluctantly order your release.\" \"that one should stand in an aquarium,\" says the arresting officer. the buyer spreads terror throughout the industry. junkies and agents disappear. like a vampire bat he gives off a narcotic effluvium, a dank green mist that anesthetizes his victims and renders them helpless in his enveloping presence. and once he has scored he holes up for several days like a gorged boa constrictor. finally he is caught in the act of digesting the narcotics commissioner and destroyed with a flame thrower -- the court of inquiry ruling that such means were justified in that the buyer had lost his human citizenship and was, in consequence, a creature without species and a menace to the narcotics industry on all levels. in mexico the gimmick is to find a local junky with a government script whereby they are allowed a certain quantity every month. our man was old ike who had spent most of his life in the states. \"i was traveling with irene kelly and her was a sporting woman. in butte, state of montana, she gets the coke horrors and run through the hotel screaming chinese coppers chase her with meat cleavers. i knew this cop in chicago sniff coke used to come in form of crystals, blue crystals. so he go nuts and start screaming the federals is after him and run down this alley and stick his head in the garbage can. and i said, 'what you think you are doing?' and he say, 'get away or i shoot you. i got myself hid good.'\"  \f",

      "17  benway so i am assigned to engage the services of doctor benway for islam inc. dr. benway had been called in as advisor to the freeland republic, a place given over to free love and continual bathing. the citizens are well adjusted, cooperative, honest, tolerant and above all clean. but the invoking of benway indicates all is not well behind that hygienic facade: benway is a manipulator and coordinator of symbol systems, an expert on all phases of interrogation, brainwashing and control. i have not seen benway since his precipitate departure from annexia, where his assignment had been t.d.-- total demoralization. benway's first act was to abolish concentration camps, mass arrest and, except under certain limited and special circumstances, the use of torture. \"i deplore brutality,\" he said. \"it's not efficient. on the other hand, prolonged mistreatment, short of physical violence, gives rise, when skillfully applied, to anxiety and a feeling of special guilt. a few rules or rather guiding principles are to be borne in mind. the subject must not realize that the mistreatment is a deliberate attack of an anti-human enemy on his personal identity. he must be made to feel that he deserves any treatment he receives because there is something (never specified) horribly wrong with him. the naked need of the control addicts must be decently covered by an arbitrary and intricate bureaucracy so that the subject cannot contact his enemy direct.\" every citizen of annexia was required to apply for and carry on his person at all times a whole portfolio of documents. citizens were subject to be stopped in the street at any time; and the examiner, who might be in plain clothes, in various uniforms, often in a bathing suit or pyjamas, sometimes stark naked except for a badge pinned to his left nipple, after checking each paper, would stamp it. on subsequent inspection the citizen was required to show the properly entered stamps of the last inspection. the examiner, when he stopped a large group, would only examine and stamp the cards of a few. the others were then subject to arrest because their cards were not properly stamped. arrest meant \"provisional detention\"; that is, the prisoner would be released if and when his affidavit of explanation, properly signed and stamped, was approved by the assistant arbiter of explanations. since this official hardly ever came to his office, and the affidavit of explanation had to be presented in person, the explainers spent weeks and months waiting around in unheated offices with no chairs and no toilet facilities. documents issued in vanishing ink faded into old pawn tickets. new documents were constantly required. the citizens rushed from one bureau to another in a frenzied attempt to meet impossible deadlines. all benches were removed from the city, all fountains turned off, all flowers and trees destroyed. huge electric buzzers on the top of every apartment house (everyone lived in apartments) rang the quarter hour. often the vibrations would throw people out of bed. searchlights played over the town all night (no one was permitted to use shades, curtains, shutters or blinds). no one ever looked at anyone else because of the strict law against importuning, with or without verbal approach, anyone for any purpose, sexual or otherwise. all cafes and bars were closed. liquor could only be obtained with a special permit, and the liquor so obtained could not be sold or given or in any way transferred to anyone else, and the presence of anyone else in the room was considered prima facie evidence of conspiracy to transfer liquor. no one was permitted to bolt his door, and the police had pass keys to every room in the city. accompanied by a mentalist they rush into someone's quarters and start \"looking for it.\"  \f",
      "18  the mentalist guides them to whatever the man wishes to hide: a tube of vaseline, an enema, a handkerchief with come on it, a weapon, unlicensed alcohol. and they always submitted the suspect to the most humiliating search of his naked person on which they make sneering and derogatory comments. many a latent homosexual was carried out in a straitjacket when they planted vaseline in his ass. or they pounce on any object. a pen wiper or a shoe tree. \"and what is this supposed to be for?\" \"it's a pen wiper.\" \"a pen wiper, he says.\" \"i've heard everything now.\" \"i guess this is all we need. come on, you.\" after a few months of this the citizens cowered in corners like neurotic cats. of course the annexia police processed suspected agents, saboteurs and political deviants on an assembly line basis. as regards the interrogation of suspects, ben- way has this to say: \"while in general i avoid the use of torture -- torture locates the opponent and mobilizes resistance -- the threat of torture is useful to induce in the subject the appropriate feeling of helplessness and gratitude to the interrogator for withholding it. and torture can be employed to advantage as a penalty when the subject is far enough along with the treatment to accept punishment as deserved. to this end i devised several forms of disciplinary procedure. one was known as the switchboard. electric drills that can be turned on at any time are clamped against the subject's teeth; and he is instructed to operate an arbitrary switchboard, to put certain connections in certain sockets in response to bells and lights. every time he makes a mistake the drills are turned on for twenty seconds. the signals are gradually speeded up beyond his reaction time. half an hour on the switchboard and the subject breaks down like an overloaded thinking machine. \"the study of thinking machines teaches us more about the brain than we can learn by introspective methods. western man is externalizing himself in the form of gadgets. ever pop coke in the mainline? it hits you right in the brain, activating connections of pure pleasure. the pleasure of morphine is in the viscera. you listen down into yourself after a shot. but c is electricity through the brain, and the c yen is of the brain alone, a need without body and without feeling. the c-charged brain is a berserk pinball machine, flashing blue and pink lights in electric orgasm. c pleasure could be felt by a thinking machine, the first stirrings of hideous insect life. the craving for c lasts only a few hours, as long as the c channels are stimulated. of course the effect of c could be produced by an electric current activating the c channels.... \"so after a bit the channels wear out like veins, and the addict has to find new ones. a vein will come back in time, and by adroit vein rotation a junky can piece out the odds if he don't become an oil burner. but brain cells don't come back once they're gone, and when the addict runs out of brain cells he is in a terrible fucking position. \"squatting on old bones and excrement and rusty iron, in a white blaze of heat, a panorama of naked idiots stretches to the horizon. complete silence -- their speech centers are destroyed -except for the crackle of sparks and the popping of singed flesh as they apply electrodes up and down the spine. white smoke of burning flesh hangs in the motionless air. a group of children have tied an idiot to a post with barbed wire and built a fire between his legs and stand watching with bestial curiosity as the flames lick his thighs. his flesh jerks in the fire with insect agony. \"i digress as usual. pending more precise knowledge of brain electronics, drugs remain an essential tool of the interrogator in his assault on the subject's personal identity. the barbiturates are, of course, virtually useless. that is, anyone who can be broken down by such means would succumb to the puerile methods used in an american precinct. scopolamine is often effective in dissolving  \f",

'now, now. let's not be negative, boy. poppa call nasty man. take baby walkabout switchboard.' \"the case of a female agent who forgot her real identity and merged with her cover story -- she is still a fricoteuse in annexia -- put me onto another gimmick. an agent is trained to deny his agent identity by asserting his cover story. so why not use psychic jiu-jitsu and go along with him? suggest that his cover story is his identity and that he has no other. his agent identity becomes unconscious, that is, out of his control; and you can dig it with drugs and hypnosis. you can make a square heterosexual citizen queer with this angle... that is, reinforce and second his rejection of normally latent homosexual trends -- at the same time depriving him of cunt and subjecting him to homosexual stimulation. then drugs, hypnosis, and --\" benway flipped a limp wrist. \"many subjects are vulnerable to sexual humiliation. nakedness, stimulation with aphrodisiacs, constant supervision to embarrass subject and prevent relief of masturbation (erections during sleep automatically turn on an enormous vibrating electric buzzer that throws the subject out of bed into cold water, thus reducing the incidence of wet dreams to a minimum). kicks to hypnotize a priest and tell him he is about to consummate a hypostatic union with the lamb -- then steer a randy old sheep up his ass. after that the interrogator can gain complete hypnotic control -- the subject will come at his whistle, shit on the floor if he but say open sesame. needless to say, the sex humiliation angle is contraindicated for overt homosexuals. (i mean let's keep our eye on the ball here and remember the old party line... never know who's listening in.) i recall this one kid, i condition to shit at sight of me. then i wash his ass and screw him. it was real tasty. and he was a lovely fellah too. and some times a subject will burst into boyish tears because he can't keep from ejaculate when you screw him. well, as you can plainly see, the possibilities are endless like meandering paths in a great big beautiful garden. i was just scratching that lovely surface when i am purged by party poops. ...well, 'son cosas de la vida.' \"  \f",

(slunks are underage calves trailing afterbirths and bacteria, generally in an unsanitary and unfit condition. a calf may not be sold as food until it reaches a minimum age of six weeks. prior to that time it is classified as a slunk. slunk trafficking is subject to a heavy penalty.) well, juanito controlled a fleet of cargo boats he register under the abyssinian flag to avoid bothersome restrictions. he gives me a job as ship's doctor on the s.s. filiarisis, as filthy a craft as ever sailed the seas. operating with one hand, beating the rats offa my patient with the other and bedbugs and scorpions rain down from the ceiling. \"so somebody wants homogeneity at this juncture. can do but it costs. bored with the whole project, me. ...here we are.... drag alley.\" benway traces a pattern in the air with his hand and a door swings open. we step through and the door closes. a long ward gleaming with stainless steel, white tile floors, glass brick walls. beds along one wall. no one smokes, no one reads, no one talks. \"come and take a close look,\" says benway. \"you won't embarrass anybody.\" i walk over and stand in front of a man who is sitting on his bed. i look at the man's eyes. nobody, nothing looks back. \"ind's,\" says benway, \"irreversible neural damage. overliberated, you might say... a drag on the industry.\" i pass a hand in front of the man's eyes. \"yes,\" says benway, \"they still have reflexes. watch this.\" benway takes a chocolate bar from his pocket, removes the wrapper and holds it in front of the man's nose. the man sniffs. his jaws begin to work. he makes snatching motions with his hands. saliva drips from his mouth and hangs off his chin in long streamers. his stomach rumbles. his whole body writhes in peristalsis. benway steps back and holds up the chocolate. the man drops to his knees, throws back his head and barks. benway tosses the chocolate. the man snaps at it, misses, scrambles around on the floor making slobbering noises. he crawls under the bed, finds the chocolate and crams it into his mouth with both hands. \"jesus! these id's got no class to them.\" benway calls over the attendant who is sitting at one end of the ward reading a book of j. m. barrie's plays. \"get these fucking id's outa here. it's a bring down already. bad for the tourist business.\"  \f",
      "22  \"what should i do with them?\" \"how in the fuck should i know? i'm a scientist. a pure scientist. just get them outa here. i don't hafta look at them is all. they constitute an albatross.\" \"but what? where?\" \"proper channels. buzz the district coordinator or whatever he calls himself... new title every week. doubt if he exists.\" doctor benway pauses at the door and looks back at the ind's. \"our failures,\" he says. \"well, it's all in the day's work.\" \"do they ever come back?\" \"they don't come back, won't come back, once they're gone,\" benway sings softly. \"now this ward has some innarest.' the patients stand in groups talking and spitting on the floor. junk hangs in the air like a grey haze. \"a heart-warming sight,\" says benway, \"those junkies standing around waiting for the man. six months ago they were all schizophrenic. some of them hadn't been out of bed for years. now look at them. in all the course of my practices, i have never seen a schizophrenic junky, and junkies are mostly of the schizo physical type. want to cure anybody of anything, find out who doesn't have it. so who don't got it'? junkies don't got it. oh, incidentally, there's an area in bolivia with no psychosis. right sane folk in them hills. like to get in there, me, before it is loused up by literacy, advertising, tv and drive-ins. make a study strictly from metabolism: diet, use of drugs and alcohol, sex, etc. who cares what they think? same nonsense everybody thinks, i daresay. \"and why don't junkies got schizophrenia? don't know yet. a schizophrenic can ignore hunger and starve to death if he isn't fed. no one can ignore heroin withdrawal. the fact of addiction imposes contact. \"but that's only one angle. mescaline, lsd6, deteriorated adrenaline, harmaline can produce an approximate schizophrenia. the best stuff is extracted from the blood of schizos; so schizophrenia is likely a drug psychosis. they got a metabolic connection, a man within you might say. ( interested readers are referred to appendix.) \"in the terminal stage of schizophrenia the back brain is permanently depressed, and the front brain is almost without content since the front brain is only active in response to back brain stimulation. \"morphine calls forth the antidote of back brain stimulation similar to schizo substance. (note similarity between withdrawal syndrome and intoxication with yage or lsd6.) eventual result of junk use -- especially true of heroin addiction where large doses are available to the addict -- is permanent backbrain depression and a state much like terminal schizophrenia: complete lack of affect, autism, virtual absence of cerebral event. the addict can spend eight hours looking at a wall. he is conscious of his surroundings, hut they have no emotional connotation and in consequence no interest. remembering a period of heavy addiction is like playing back a tape recording of events experienced by the front brain alone. flat statements of external events. 'i went to the store and bought some brown sugar. i came home and ate half the box. i took a three grain shot etc.' complete absence of nostalgia in these memories. however, as soon as junk intake falls below par, the withdrawal substance floods the body. \"if all pleasure is relief from tension, junk affords relief from the whole life process, in disconnecting the hypothalamus, which is the center of psychic energy and libido. \"some of my learned colleagues (nameless assholes) have suggested that junk derives its euphoric effect from direct stimulation of the orgasm center. it seems more probable that junk  \f",
      "23  suspends the whole cycle of tension, discharge and rest. the orgasm has no function in the junky. boredom, which always indicates an undischarged tension, never troubles the addict. he can look at his shoe for eight hours. he is only roused to action when the hourglass of junk runs out.\" at the far end of the ward an attendant throws up an iron shutter and lets out a hog call. the junkies rush up grunting and squealing. \"wise guy,\" says benway. \"no respect for human dignity. now i'll show you the mild deviant and criminal ward. yes, a criminal is a mild deviant here. he doesn't deny the freeland contract. he merely seeks to circumvent some of the clauses. reprehensible but not too serious. down this hall... we'll skip wards 23, 86, 57 and 97... and the laboratory.\" \"are homosexuals classed as deviants?' \"no. remember the bismarck archipelago. no overt homosexuality. a functioning police state needs no police. homosexuality does not occur to anyone as conceivable behaviour.... homosexuality is a political crime in a matriarchy. no society tolerates overt rejection of its basic tenets. we aren't a matriarchy here, insh'allah. you know the experiment with rats where they are subject to this electric shock and dropped in cold water if they so much as move at a female. so they all become fruit rats and that's the way it is with the etiology. and shall such a rat squeak out, 'i'm queah and i luuuuuuuuve it' or 'who cut yours off, you two- holed freak?' 'twere a square rat so to squeak. during my rather brief experience as a psychoanalyst -- spot of bother with the society -one patient ran amok in grand central with a flame thrower, two committed suicide and one died on the couch like a jungle rat (jungle rats are subject to die if confronted suddenly with a hopeless situation). so his relations beef and i tell them, 'it's all in the day's work. get this stiff outa here. it's a bring down for my live patients' -- i noticed that all my homosexual patients manifested strong unconscious heterosex trends and all my hetero patients unconscious homosexual trends. makes the brain reel, don't it?\" \"and what do you conclude from that?\" \"conclude? nothing whatever. just a passing observation.\" we are eating lunch in benway's office when he gets a call. \"what's that?... monstrous! fantastic!... carry on and stand by.\" he puts down the phone. \"i am prepared to accept immediate assignment with islam incorporated. it seems the electronic brain went berserk playing six-dimensional chess with the technician and released every subject in the r.c. leave us adjourn to the roof. operation helicopter is indicated.\" from the roof of the r.c. we survey a scene of unparalleled horror. ind's stand around in front of the cafe tables, long streamers of saliva hanging off their chins, stomachs noisily churning, others ejaculate at the sight of women. latahs imitate the passers-by with monkey-like obscenity. junkies have looted the drugstores and fix on every street corner.... catatonics decorate the parks.... agitated schizophrenics rush through the streets with mangled, inhuman cries. a group of p.r.'s -partially reconditioned -- have surrounded some homosexual tourists with horrible knowing smiles showing the nordic skull beneath in double exposure. \"what do you want?\" snaps one of the queens. \"we want to understand you.\" a contingent of howling simopaths swing from chandeliers, balconies and trees, shitting and pissing on passers-by. (a simopath -- the technical name for this disorder escapes me -- is a citizen convinced he is an ape or other simian. it is a disorder peculiar to the army, and discharge cures it) amoks trot along cutting off heads, faces sweet and remote with a dreamy half smile. ...citizens with  \f",

      "28  carl saw joselito in a big clean room full of light, with private bath and concrete balcony. and nothing to talk about there in the cold empty room, water hyacinths growing in a yellow bowl and the china blue sky and drifting clouds, fear flickering in and out of his eyes. when he smiled the fear flew away in little pieces of light, lurked enigmatically in the high cool corners of the room. and what could i say feeling death around me, and the little broken images that come before sleep, there in the mind? \"they will send me to the new sanitarium tomorrow. come and visit me. i will be there alone.\" he coughed and took a codeineeta. \"doctor i understand, that is i have been given to understand, i have read and heard -- not a medical man myself -- don't pretend to be-that the concept of sanitarium treatment has been more or less supplanted, or at least very definitely supplemented, by chemical therapy. is this accurate in your opinion? what i mean to say is, doctor, please tell me in all sincerity, as one human being to another, what is your opinion of chemical versus sanitarium therapy? are you a partisan?\" the doctor's liver sick indian face was blank as a dealer's. \"completely modern, as you can see,\" he gestures toward the room with the purple fingers of bad circulation. \"bath... water... flowers. the lot.\" he finished in cockney english with a triumphant smirk. \"i will write for you a letter.\" \"this letter? for the sanitarium?\" the doctor was speaking from a land of black rocks and great, iridescent brown lagoons. \"the furniture... modern and comfortable. you find it so of course?\" carl could not see the sanitarium owing to a false front of green stucco topped by an intricate neon sign dead and sinister against the sky, waiting for darkness. the sanitarium was evidently built on a great limestone promontory, over which flowering trees and vine tendrils broke in waves. the smell of flowers was heavy in the air. the commandante sat at a long wooden trestle under a vine trellis. he was doing absolutely nothing. he took the letter that carl handed him and whispered through it, reading his lips with the left hand. he stuck the letter on a spike over a toilet. he began transcribing from a ledger full of numbers. he wrote on and on. broken images exploded softly in carl's head, and he was moving out of himself in a silent swoop. clear and sharp from a great distance he saw himself sitting in a lunchroom. overdose of h. his old lady shaking him and holding hot coffee under his nose. outside an old junky in santa claus suit selling christmas seals. \"fight tuberculosis, folks,\" he whispers in his disembodied, junky voice. salvation army choir of sincere, homosexual football coaches sings: \"in the sweet bye and bye.\" carl drifted back into his body, an earthbound junk ghost. \"i could bribe him, of course.\" the commandante taps the table with one finger and hums \"coming through the rye.\" far away, then urgently near like a foghorn a split second before the grinding crash. carl pulled a note half out of his trouser pocket.... the commandante was standing by a vast panel of lockers and deposit boxes. he looked at carl, sick animal eyes gone out, dying inside, hopeless fear reflecting the face of death. in the smell of flowers a note half out of his pocket, the weakness hit carl, shutting of his breath, stopping his blood. he was in a great cone spinning down to a black point. \"chemical therapy?\" the scream shot out of his flesh through empty locker rooms and barracks, musty resort hotels, and spectral, coughing corridors of t,b. sanitariums, the muttering, hawking,  \f",

      "31  at all levels criss-cross of bridges, cat walks, cable cars. catatonic youths dressed as women in gowns of burlap and rotten rags, faces heavily and crudely painted in bright colors over a strata of beatings, arabesques of broken, suppurating scars to the pearly bone, push against the passer-by in silent clinging insistence. traffickers in the black meat, flesh of the giant aquatic black centipede -- sometimes attaining a length of six feet -- found in a lane of black rocks and iridescent, brown lagoons, exhibit paralyzed crustaceans in camouflage pockets of the plaza visible only to the meat eaters. followers of obsolete unthinkable trades, doodling in etruscan, addicts of drugs not yet synthesized, black marketeers of world war iii, excisors of telepathic sensitivity, osteopaths of the spirit, investigators of infractions denounced by bland paranoid chess players, servers of fragmentary warrants taken down in hebephrenic shorthand charging unspeakable mutilations of the spirit, officials of unconstituted police states, brokers of exquisite dreams and nostalgias tested on the sensitized cells of junk sickness and bartered for raw materials of the will, drinkers of the heavy fluid sealed in translucent amber of dreams. the meet cafe occupies one side of the plaza, a maze of kitchens, restaurants, sleeping cubicles, perilous iron balconies and basements opening into the underground baths. on stools covered in white satin sit naked mugwumps sucking translucent, colored syrups through alabaster straws. mugwumps have no liver and nourish themselves exclusively on sweets. thin, purple-blue lips cover a razor-sharp beak of black bone with which they frequently tear each other to shreds in fights over clients. these creatures secrete an addicting fluid from their erect penises which prolongs life by slowing metabolism. (in fact all longevity agents have proved addicting in exact ratio to their effectiveness in prolonging life.) addicts of mugwump fluid are known as reptiles. a number of these flow over chairs with their flexible bones and black-pink flesh. a fan of green cartilage covered with hollow, erectile hairs through which the reptiles absorb the fluid sprouts from behind each ear. the fans, which move from time to time touched by invisible currents, serve also same form of communication known only to reptiles. during the biennial panics when the raw, pealed dream police storm the city, the mugwumps take refuge in the deepest crevices of the wall sealing themselves in clay cubicles and remain for weeks in biostasis. in those days of grey terror the reptiles dart about faster and faster, scream past each other at supersonic speed, their flexible skulls flapping in black winds of insect agony. the dream police disintegrate in globs of rotten ectoplasm swept away by an old junky, coughing and spitting in the sick morning. the mugwump man comes with alabaster jars of fluid and the reptiles get smoothed out. the air is once again still and clear as glycerine. the sailor spotted his reptile. he drifted over and ordered a green syrup. the reptile had a little, round disk mouth of brown gristle, expressionless green eyes almost covered by a thin membrane of eyelid. the sailor waited an hour before the creature picked up his presence. \"any eggs for fats?\" he asked, his words stirring through the reptile's fan hairs. it took two hours for the reptile to raise three pink transparent fingers covered with black fuzz. several meat eaters lay in vomit, too weak to move. (the black meat is like a tainted cheese, overpoweringly delicious and nauseating so that the eaters eat and vomit and eat again until they fall exhausted.) a painted youth slithered in and seized one of the great black claws sending the sweet, sick smell curling through the cafe.  \f",

(ash-brown is a color like grey under brown skin. you sometimes find it in mixed negro and white stock, the mixture did not come of and the colors separated out like oil on water....) the guard is a sharp dresser, since he has nothing to do and saves all his pay to buy fine clothes and changes three times a day in front of an enormous magnifying mirror. he has a latin handsomesmooth face with a pencil line mustache, small black eyes, blank and greedy, undreaming insect eyes. when i get to the frontier the guard rushes out of his casita, a mirror in a wooden frame slung round his neck. he is trying to get the mirror off his neck.... this has never happened before, that anyone reached the frontier. the guard has injured his larynx taking off the mirror frame.... he has  \f",

'fucking undisciplined cells!' he would snarl, advancing on the tumor like a knifefighter.\" a young man leaps down into the operating theatre and, whipping out a scalpel, advances on the patient. dr. benway: \"an espontaneo stop him before he guts my patient!\" (espontaneo is a bull-fighting term for a member of the audience who leaps down into the ring, pulls out a concealed cape and attempts a few passes with the bull before he is dragged out of the ring.) the orderlies scuffle with the espontaneo, who is finally ejected from the hall. the anesthetist takes advantage of the confusion to pry a large gold filling from the patient's mouth.... i am passing room 10 they moved me out of yesterday.... maternity case i assume... bedpans full of blood and kotex and nameless female substances, enough to pollute a continent... if someone comes to visit me in my old room he will think i gave birth to a monster and the state department is trying to hush it up.... music from i am an american... an elderly man in the striped pants and cutaway of a diplomat stands on a platform draped with the american flag. a decayed, corseted tenor -- bursting out of a daniel boone costume -- is singing the star spangled banner, accompanied by a full orchestra. he sings with a slight lisp.... the diplomat (reading from a great scroll of ticker tape that keeps growing and tangling around his feet): \"and we categorically deny that any male citizen of the united states of america...\" tenor: \"oh thay can you thee...\" his voice breaks and shoots up to a high falsetto. in the control room the technician mixes a bicarbonate of soda and belches into his hand: \"god damned tenor's a brown artist!\" he mutters sourly. \"mikel rumph,\" the shout ends in a belch. \"cut that swish fart off the air and give him his purple slip. he's through as of right now.... put in that sexchanged liz athlete.... she's a fulltime tenor at least.... costume? how in the fuck should i know? i'm no dress designer swish from the costume department! what's that? the entire costume department occluded as a security risk? what am i, an octopus? let's see... how about an indian  \f",

      "39  shutters of survival. he ordered the burning bed and its occupant immediately evicted from the hospital premises. \"guess he can make his own penicillin!\" snarled the doctor. but the infection burned the mold out... lee lived now in varying degrees of transparency... while not exactly invisible he was at least difficult to see. his presence attracted no special notice.... people covered him with a project or dismissed him as a reflection, shadow: \"some kinda light trick or neon advertisement.\" now lee felt the first seismic tremors of old faithful the cold burn. he pushed miguel's spirit into the hall with a kind, firm tendril. \"jesus!\" said miguel. \"i gotta go!\" he rushed out. pink fires of histamine spurted from lee's glowing core and covered his raw periphery. (the room was fireproof, the walls of iron blistered and spotted with moon craters.) he took a large fix and falsified his schedule. he decided to visit a colleague, ng joe, who got hooked during a bang-utot attack in honolulu. (note: rang-utot, literally, \"attempting to get up and groaning...\" death occurring in the course of a nightmare... the condition occurs in males of s.e. asiatic extraction.... in manila about twelve cases of death by bang-utot are recorded each year. one man who recovered said that \"a little man\" was sitting on his chest and strangling him. victims often know that they are going to die, express the fear that their penis will enter the body and kill them. sometimes they cling to the penis in a state of shrieking hysteria calling on others for help lest the penis escape and pierce the body. erections, such as normally occur in sleep, are considered especially dangerous and liable to bring a fatal attack.... one man devised a rube goldberg contraption to prevent erection during sleep. but he died of bang-utot. careful autopsies of bang-utot victims have revealed no organic reason for death. there are often signs of strangulation (caused by what?); sometimes slight hemorrhages of pancreas and lungs - not sufficient to cause death and also of unknown origin. it has occurred to the author that the cause of death is a misplacement of sexual energy resulting in a lung erection with consequent strangulation.... [see article by nils larsen m.d., the men with the deadly dream in the saturday evening post, december 3, 1955. also article by erle stanley gardner for true magazine.]) ng lived in constant fear of erection so his habit jumped and jumped.

(to get cured means to get rich. expression used by texas oil men.) the pure food and drug department have his picture in their files, a heavy faced man with an embalmed look as if paraffin had been injected under the skin which is smooth, shiny and poreless. one eye is dead grey color, round as a marble, with flaws and opaque spots. the other is black and shiny, an old undreaming insect eye. his eyes are normally invisible behind black glasses. he looks sinister and enigmatic -- his gestures and mannerisms are not yet comprehensible -- like the secret police of a larval state. in moments of excitement salvador is apt to lapse into broken english. his accent at such moments suggests an italian origin. he reads and speaks etruscan, a squad of accountant investigators have made a life work of sal's international dossier.... his operations extend through the world in an inextricable, shifting web of subsidiaries, front companies, and aliases. he has held 23 passports and been deported 49 times -- deportation proceedings pending in cuba, pakistan, hong-kong and yokohama. salvador hassan o'leary, alias the shoe store kid, alias wrong way marv, alias after birth leary, alias slunky pete, alias placenta juan, alias k. y. ahmed, alias el chinche, alias el culito, etc., etc. for fifteen solid pages of dossier, first tangled with the law in nyc where he was traveling with a character known to the brooklyn police as blubber wilson, who hustled his goof ball money shaking down fetishists in shoe stores. hassan was charged some third degree extortion and conspiracy to impersonate a police officer. he had learnt the shakeman's number one rule: d.t.-ditch tin -- which corresponds to the pilot's kfs -- keep flying speed.... as the vigilante puts it: \"if you get a rumble, kid, ditch your piece of tin if you have to swallow it.\" so they didn't bust him with a queer badge. hassan testified against wilson, who drew pen indef. (longest term possible under new york law for a misdemeanor conviction. nominally an indefinite sentence, it means three years in riker's island). hassan's case was nolle prossed. \"i'd have drawn a nickel,\" hassan said, \"if i hadn't met a decent cop.\" hassan met a decent cop every time he took a fall. his dossier contains three pages of monikers indicating his proclivity for cooperating with the law, \"playing ball\" the cops call it. others call it something else: ab the fuzz lover, finky marv, the crooning hebe, ali the stool, wrongo sal, the wailing spic, the sheeny soprano, the bronx opera house, the copper's djinn, the answering service, the squeaking syrian, the cooing cocksucker, the musical fruit, the wrong ass hole, the fairy fink, leary the nark, the lilting leprechaun... grassy gert. he opened a sex shop in yokohama, pushed junk in beirut, pimped in panama. during world war ii he shifted into high, took over a dairy in holland and cut the butter with used axle grease, cornered the k.y. market in north africa, and finally hit the jackpot with slunks. he prospered and proliferated, hooding the world with cut medicines and cheap counterfeit goods of every variety. adulterated shark repellent, cut antibiotics, condemned parachutes, stale anti-venom, inactive serums and vaccines, leaking lifeboats. clem and jody, two oldtime vaudeville hoofers, cope out as russian agents whose sole function is to represent the u.s. in an unpopular light. when arrested for sodomy in indonesia, clem said to the examining magistrate: \"'tain't as if it was being queer. after all they's only gooks.\" they appeared in liberia dressed in black stetsons and red galluses: \"so i shoot that old nigger and he flop on his side one leg up in the air just akicking.\" \"yeah, but you ever burn a nigger?\"  \f",

(six separate venereal diseases have been identified to date.) they plunge into the deal. they form unmentionable services for a spastic greek shipping agent, and one entire shift of customs inspectors. the two partners fall out and finally denounce each other in the embassy where they are referred to the we don't want to hear about it department, and eased out a back door into a shit-strewn vacant lot, where vultures fight over fish heads. they flail at each other hysterically. 'you're trying to fuck me out of my commission!\" \"your commission! who smelled out this good thing in the first place?\" \"but i have the bill of lading.\" \"monster! but the check will be made out in my name.\" \"bawstard! you'll never see the bill of lading until my cut is deposited in escrow.\"  \f",
      "89  \"well, might as well kiss and make up. there's nothing mean or petty about me.\" they shake hands without enthusiasm and peck each other on the cheek. the deal drags on for months. they engage the services of an expeditor. finally marvie emerges with a check for 42 turkestan kurds drawn on an anonymous bank in south america, to clear through amsterdam, a procedure that will take eleven months more or less. now he can relax in the cafes of the plaza. he shows a photostatic copy of the check. he would never show the original of course, lest some envious citizen spit ink eradicator on the signature or otherwise mutilate the check. everyone asks him to buy drinks and celebrate, but he laughs jovially and says, \"fact is i can't afford to buy myself a drink. i already spent every kurd of it buying penstrep for ali's clap. he's down with it fore and aft again. i came near kicking the little bastard right through the wall into the next bed. but you all know what a sentimental old thing i am.\" marvie does buy himself a shot glass of beer, squeezing a blackened coin out of his fly onto the table. \"keep the change.\" the waiter sweeps the coin into a dust pan, he spits on the table and walks away. \"sore head! he's envious of my check.\" marvie had been in interzone since \"the year before one\" as he put it. he had been retired from some unspecified position in the state dept. \"for the good of the service.\" obviously he had once been very good looking in a crew-cut, college boy way, but his face had sagged and formed lumps under the chin like melting paraffin. he was getting heavy around the hips. leif the unlucky was a tall, thin norwegian, with a patch over one eye, his face congealed in a permanent, ingratiating smirk. behind him lay an epic saga of unsuccessful enterprises. he had failed at raising frogs, chinchilla, siamese fighting fish, rami and culture pearls. he had attempted, variously and without success, to promote a love bird two-in-a-coffin cemetery, to corner the condom market during the rubber shortage, to run a mail order whore house, to issue penicillin as a patent medicine. he had followed disastrous betting systems in the casinos of europe and the race tracks of the u.s. his reverses in business were matched by the incredible mischances of his personal life. his front teeth had been stomped out by bestial american sailors in brooklyn. vultures had eaten out an eye when he drank a pint of paregoric and passed out in a panama city park. he had been trapped between floors in an elevator for five days with an oil-burning junk habit and sustained an attack of d.t.s while stowing away in a foot locker. then there was the time he collapsed with strangulated intestines, perforated ulcers and peritonitis in cairo and the hospital was so crowded they bedded him in the latrine, and the greek surgeon goofed and sewed up a live monkey in him, and he was gangfucked by the arab attendants, and one of the orderlies stole the penicillin substituting saniflush; and the time he got clap in his ass and a self-righteous english doctor cured him with an enema of hot, sulphuric acid, and the german practitioner of technological medicine who removed his appendix with a rusty can opener and a pair of tin snips (he considered the germ theory \"a nonsense.\") flushed with success he then began snipping and cutting out everything in sight: \"the human body is filled up vit unnecessitated parts. you can get by vit one kidney. vy have two? yes dot is a kidney.... the inside parts should not be so close in together crowded. they need lebensraum like the vaterland.\" the expeditor had not yet been paid, and marvie was faced by the prospect of stalling him for eleven months until the check cleared. the expeditor was said to have been born on the ferry between the zone and the island. his profession was to expedite the delivery of merchandise. no one knew for sure whether his services were of any use or not, and to mention his name always  \f",

      "91  \"oh it's all very well for you chaps, you can scud out from under. but i have a reputation to maintain.... there'll be a spot of bother about this.\" \"do you suggest there is something illegitimate in this operation?\" \"not illegitimate exactly. but shoddy. definitely shoddy.\" \"oh go back to your island before it falls! we knew you when you were peddling your purple ass in the plaza pissoirs for five pesetas.\" \"and not many takers either,\" leif put in. he pronounced it ither. this reference to his island origin was more than the expeditor could stand.... he was drawing himself up, mobilizing his most frigid impersonation of an english aristocrat, preparing to deliver an icy, clipped \"crusher,\" but instead, a whining, whimpering, kicked dog snarl broke from his mouth. his presurgery face emerged in an arc-light of incandescent hate.... he began to spit curses in the hideous, strangled gutturals of the island dialect. the islanders all profess ignorance of the dialect or flatly deny its existence. \"we are breetish,\" they say. \"we don't got no bloody dealect.\" froth gathered at the corners of the expeditor's mouth. he was spitting little balls of saliva like pieces of cotton. the stench of spiritual vileness hung in the airs about him like a green cloud. marvie and leif fell back twittering in alarm. 'he's gone mad,\" marvie gasped. \"let's get out of here.\" hand in hand they skip away into the mist that covers the zone in the winter months like a cold turkish bath.  \f",

      "93  that is to say, of course, the minimum hardship compatible with adequate protection of other individuals who are not so infected.... we do not find obligatory vaccination for smallpox an unreasonable measure.... nor isolation for certain contagious diseases.... i am sure you will agree that individuals infected with hurumph what the french call 'les maladies galantes' heh heh heh should be compelled to undergo treatment if they do not report voluntarily.\" the doctor went on chuckling and rocking in his chair like a mechanical toy.... carl realized that he was expected to say something. \"that seems reasonable,\" he said. the doctor stopped chuckling. he was suddenly motionless. \"now to get back to this uh matter of sexual deviation. frankly we don't pretend to understand -- at least not completely -- why some men and women prefer the uh sexual company of their own sex. we do know that the uh phenomena is common enough, and, under certain circumstances a matter of uh concern to this department.\" for the first time the doctor's eyes flickered across carl's face. eyes without a trace of warmth or hate or any emotion that carl had ever experienced in himself or seen in another, at once cold and intense, predatory and impersonal. carl suddenly felt trapped in this silent underwater cave of a room, cut off from all sources of warmth and certainty. his picture of himself sitting there calm, alert with a trace of well mannered contempt went dim, as if vitality were draining out of him to mix with the milky grey medium of the room. \"treatment of these disorders is, at the present time, hurmph symptomatic.\" the doctor suddenly threw himself back in his chair and burst into peals of metallic laughter. carl watched him appalled.... \"the man is insane,\" he thought. the doctor's face went blank as a gambler's. carl felt an odd sensation in his stomach like the sudden stopping of an elevator. the doctor was studying the file in front of him. he spoke in a tone of slightly condescending amusement: \"don't look so frightened, young man. just a professional joke. to say treatment is symptomatic means there is none, except to make the patient feel as comfortable as possible. and that is precisely what we attempt to do in these cases.\" once again carl felt the impact of that cold interest on his face. \"that is to say reassurance when reassurance is necessary... and, of course, suitable outlets with other individuals of similar tendencies. no isolation is indicated... the condition is no more directly contagious than cancer. cancer, my first love,\" the doctor's voice receded. he seemed actually to have gone away through an invisible door leaving his empty body sitting there at the desk. suddenly he spoke again in a crisp voice. \"and so you may well wonder why we concern ourselves with the matter at all?\" he flashed a smile bright and cold as snow in sunlight. carl shrugged: \"that is not my business... what i am wondering is why you have asked me to come here and why you tell me all this... this...\" \"nonsense?\" carl was annoyed to find himself blushing. the doctor leaned back and placed the ends of his fingers together: \"the young,\" he said indulgently. \"always they are in a hurry. one day perhaps you will learn the meaning of patience. no, carl... i may call you carl'? i am not evading your question. in cases of suspected tuberculosis we -- that is the appropriate department -- may ask, even request, someone to appear for a fluoroscopic examination. this is routine, you understand. most of such examinations turn up negative. so you have been asked to report here for, should i say a psychic fluoroscope? i may add that after talking with you i feel relatively sure that the result will be, for practical purposes, negative....  \f",
      "94  \"but the whole thing is ridiculous. i have always interested myself only in girls. i have a steady girl now and we plan to marry.\" \"yes carl, i know. and that is why you are here. a blood test prior to marriage, this is reasonable, no?\" \"please doctor, speak directly.\" the doctor did not seem to hear. he drifted out of his chair and began walking around behind carl, his voice languid and intermittent like music down a windy street. \"i may tell you in strictest confidence that there is definite evidence of a hereditary factor. social pressure. many homosexuals latent and overt do, unfortunately, marry. such marriages often result in... factor of infantile environment.\" the doctor's voice went on and on. he was talking about schizophrenia, cancer, hereditary disfunction of the hypothalamus. carl dozed off. he was opening a green door. a horrible smell grabbed his lungs and he woke up with a shock. the doctor's voice was strangely flat and lifeless, a whispering junky voice: \"the kleiberg-stanislouski semen floculation test... a diagnostic tool... indicative at least in a negative sense. in certain cases useful -- taken as part of the whole picture.... perhaps under the uh circumstances.\" the doctor's voice shot up to a pathic scream. \"the nurse will take your uh specimen.\" \"this way please....\" the nurse opened the door into a bare white walled cubicle. she handed him a jar. \"use this please. just yell when you're ready.\" there was a jar of k.y. on a glass shelf. carl felt ashamed as if his mother had laid out a handkerchief for him. some coy little message stitched on like: \"if i was a cunt we could open a dry goods store.\" ignoring the k.y., he ejaculated into the jar, a cold brutal fuck of the nurse standing her up against a glass brick wall. \"old glass cunt,\" he sneered, and saw a cunt full of colored glass splinters under the northern lights. he washed his penis and buttoned up his pants. something was watching his every thought and movement with cold, sneering hate, the shifting of his testes, the contractions of his rectum. he was in a room filled with green light. there was a stained wood double bed, a black wardrobe with full length mirror. carl could not see his face. someone was sitting in a black hotel chair. he was wearing a stiff bosomed white shirt and a dirty paper tie. the face swollen, skul-less, eyes like burning pus. \"something wrong?\" said the nurse indifferently. she was holding a glass of water out to him. she watched him drink with aloof contempt. she turned and picked up the jar with obvious distaste. the nurse turned to him: \"are you waiting for something special?\" she snapped. carl had never been spoken to like that in his adult life. \"why no....\" \"you can go then,\" she turned back to the jar. with a little exclamation of disgust she wiped a gob of semen off her hand. carl crossed the room and stood at the door. \"do i have another appointment?' she looked at him in disapproving surprise: \"you'll be notified of course.\" she stood in the doorway of the cubicle and watched him walk through the outer office and open the door. he turned and attempted a jaunty wave. the nurse did not move or change her expression. as he walked down the stairs the broken, false grin burned his face with shame. a homosexual tourist looked at him and raised a knowing eyebrow. \"some- thing wrong?\" carl ran into a park and found an empty bench beside a bronze faun with cymbals. \"let your hair down, chicken. you'll feel better.\" the tourist was leaning over him, his camera swinging in carl's face like a great dangling tit.  \f",
      "95  \"fuck off you!\" carl saw something ignoble and hideous reflected back in the queen's spayed animal brown eyes. \"oh! i wouldn't be calling any names if i were you, chicken. you're hooked too. i saw you coming out of the institute.\" 'what do you mean by that?\" carl demanded. \"oh nothing. nothing at all.\" \"well, carl,\" the doctor began smiling and keeping his eyes on a level with carl's mouth. \"i have some good news for you.\" he picked up a slip of blue paper off the desk and went through an elaborate pantomime of focusing his eyes on it. \"your uh test... the robinson-kleiberg floculation test...\" \"i thought it was a blomberg-stanlouski test.\" the doctor tittered. \"oh dear no.... you are getting ahead of me young man. you might have misunderstood. the blomberg-stanlouski, weeell that's a different sort of test altogether. i do hope... not necessary....\" he tittered again: \"but as i was saying before i was so charmingly interrupted... by my hurumph learned young colleague. your ks seems to be...\" he held the slip at arm's length. \"...completely uh negative. so perhaps we won't be troubling you any further. and so...\" he folded the slip carefully into a file. he leafed through the file. finally he stopped and frowned and pursed his lips. he closed the file and put his hand flat on it and leaned forward. \"carl, when you were doing your military service... there must have been... in fact there were long periods when you found yourself deprived of the uh consolations and uh facilities of the fair sex. during these no doubt trying and difficult periods you had perhaps a pin up girl? or more likely a pin up harem? heh heh heh...\" carl looked at the doctor with overt distaste. \"yes, of course,\" he said. \"we all did.\" \"and now, carl, i would like to show you some pin up girls.\" he pulled an envelope out of a drawer. \"and ask you to please pick out the one you would most like to uh make heh heh heh....\" he suddenly leaned for- ward fanning the photographs in front of carl's face. \"pick a girl, any girl!\" carl reached out with numb fingers and touched one of the photographs. the doctor put the photo back into the pack and shuffled and cut and he placed the pack on carl's file and slapped it smartly. he spread the photos face up in front of carl. \"is she there?\" carl shook his head. \"of course not. she is in here where she belongs. a woman's place what??\" he opened the file and held out the girl's photo attached to a rorshach plate. \"is that her?\" carl nodded silently. \"you have good taste, my boy. i may tell you in strictest confidence that some of these girls...\" with gambler fingers he shifts the photos in three card monte passes -- \"are really boys. in uh drag i believe is the word?\" his eyebrows shot up and down with incredible speed. carl could not be sure he had seen anything unusual. the doctor's face opposite him was absolutely immobile and expressionless. once again carl experienced the floating sensation in his stomach and genitals of a sudden elevator stop. \"yes, carl, you seem to be running our little obstacle course with flying colors.... i guess you think this is all pretty silly don't you now... ???\" \"well, to tell the truth... yes...\"  \f",
      "96  \"you are frank, carl... this is good.... and now ...carl...\" he dragged the name out caressingly like a sweet con dick about to offer you an old gold -- ( just like a cop to smoke old golds somehow) and go into his act.... the con dick does a little dance step. \"why don't you make the man a proposition?\" he jerks a head towards his glowering superego who is always referred to in the third person as \"the man\" or \"the lieutenant.\" \"that's the way the lieutenant is, you play fair with him and he'll play fair with you.... we'd like to go light on you.... if you could help us in some way.\" his words open out into a desolate waste of cafeterias and street corners and lunch rooms. junkies look the other way munching pound cake. \"the fag is wrong.\" the fag slumps in a hotel chair knocked out on goof balls with his tongue lolling out. he gets up in a goof ball trance, hangs himself with- out altering his expression or pulling his tongue in. the dick is diddling on a pad. \"know marty steel?\" diddle. \"yes.\" \"can you score off him?\" diddle? diddle? \"he's skeptical.\" \"but you can score.\" diddle diddle \"you scored off him last week didn't you?\" diddle??? \"yes.\" \"well you can score off him this week.\" diddle... diddle... diddle... \"you can score off him today.\" no diddle. \"not no! not that!!\" \"now look are you going to cooperate\" -- three vicious diddles -- \"or does the... does the man cornhole you?\" he raises a fay eyebrow. \"and so carl you will please oblige to tell me how many times and under what circumstances you have uh indulged in homosexual acts???\" his voice drifts away. \"if you have never done so i shall be inclined to think of you as a somewhat atypical young man.\" the doctor raises a coy admonishing finger. \"in any case...\" he tapped the file and flashed a hideous leer. carl noticed that the file was six inches thick. in fact it seemed to have thickened enormously since he entered the room. \"well, when i was doing my military service... these queers used to proposition me and sometimes... when i was blank...\" \"yes, of course, carl,\" the doctor brayed heartily. \"in your position i would have done the same i don't mind telling you heh heh heh.... well, e guess we can uh dismiss as irrelevant these uh understandable means of replenishing the uh exchequer. and now, carl, there were perhaps\" -- one finger tapped the file which gave out a faint effluvia of moldy jock straps and chlorine -- \"occasions. when no uh economic factors were involved.\" a green flare exploded in carl's brain. he saw hans' lean brown body -- twisting towards him, quick breath on his shoulder. the flare went out. some huge insect was squirming in his hand. his whole being jerked away in an electric spasm of revulsion. carl got to his feet shaking with rage. \"what are you writing there?\" he demanded. \"do you often doze off like that?? in the middle of a conversation... ?\" \"i wasn't asleep that is.\" \"you weren't?\"  \f",
      "97  \"it's just that the whole thing is unreal.... i'm going now. i don't care. you can't force me to stay.\" he was walking across the room towards the door. he had been walking a long time. a creeping numbness dragged his legs. the door seemed to recede. \"where can you go, carl?\" the doctor's voice reached him from a great distance. \"out... away... through the door...\" \"the green door, carl?\" the doctor's voice was barely audible. the whole room was exploding out into space.  \f",

      "99  coke bugs the sailor's grey felt hat and black overcoat hung twisted in atrophied yen-wait. morning sun outlined the sailor in the orange-yellow flame of junk. he had a paper napkin under his coffee cup - mark of those who do a lot of sitting over coffee in the plazas, restaurants, terminals and waiting rooms of the world. a junky, even at the sailor's level, runs on junk time and when he makes his importunate irruption into the time of others, like all petitioners, he must wait. (how many coffees in an hour?) a boy came in and sat at the counter in broken lines of long, sick junk-wait. the sailor shivered. his face fuzzed out of focus in a shuddering brown mist. his hands moved on the table, reading the boy's braille. his eyes traced little dips and circles, following whorls of brown hair on the boy's neck in a slow, searching movement. the boy stirred and scratched the back of his neck: \"something bit me, joe. what kinda creep joint you run here?\" \"coke bugs, kid,\" joe said, holding eggs up to the light. \"i was travelling with irene kelly and her was a sporting woman. in butte, state of montany, her got the coke horrors and run through the hotel screaming chinese coppers chase her with meat cleavers. i knew this cop in chi sniff coke used to come in form of crystals, blue crystals. so her go nuts and start screaming the federals is after him and run down this alley and stick his head in the garbage can. and i said, 'what you think you are doing? and her say, 'get away or i shoot you! i got myself led good!' when the roll is called up yonder we'll be there, right?\" joe looked at the sailor and spread his hands in the junky shrug. the sailor spoke in his feeling voice that reassembles in your head, spelling out the words with cold fingers: \"your connection is broken, kid.\" the boy shied. his street-boy face, torn with black scars of junk, retained a wild, broken innocence; shy animals peering out through grey arabesques of terror. \"i don't dig you, jack.\" the sailor leapt into sharp, junky focus. he turned back his coat lapel, showing a brass hypo needle covered with mold and verdigris. \"retired for the good of the service.... sit down and have a blueberry crumb pie on the expense account. your monkey loves it.... make his coat glossy.\" the boy felt a touch on his arm across eight feet of morning lunch room. he was suddenly siphoned into the booth, landing with an inaudible shlup. he looked into the sailor's eyes, a green universe stirred by cold black currents. \"you are agent, mister?\" \"i prefer the word... vector.\" his sounding laughter vibrated through the boy's substance. \"you holding, man? i got the bread....\" \"i don't want your money, honey: i want your time.\" \"i don't dig.\" \"you want fix? you want straight? you wanta, nooood?\" the sailor cradled something pink and vibrated out of focus. \"yeah.\" \"we'll take the independent. got their own special heat, don't carry guns only saps. i recall, me and the fag fell once in queen's plaza. stay away from queen's plaza, son... evil spot... fuzz haunted. too many levels. heat flares out from the broom closet high on ammonia like burning lions... fall on poor old lush worker, scare her veins right down to the bone. her skin pop a week or  \f",

      "102  the sailor caressed the egg with nakedly inhuman hands -- black-pink, thick, fibrous, long white tendrils sprouting from abbreviated finger tips. death fear and death weakness hit the boy, shutting off his breath, stopping his blood. he leaned against a wall that seemed to give slightly. he clicked back into junk focus. the sailor was cooking a shot. \"when the roll is called up yonder we'll be there, right?\" he said, feeling along the boy's vein, erasing goose-pimples with a gentle old woman finger. he slid the needle in. a red orchid bloomed at the bottom of the dropper. the sailor pressed the bulb, watching the solution rush into the boy-vein, sucked by silent thirst of blood. \"jesus!\" said the boy. \"i never been hit like that before!\" he lit a cigarette and looked around the kitchen, twitching in sugar need. \"aren't you taking off?\" he asked. \"with that milk sugar shit? junk is a one-way street. no u-turn. you can't go back no more.\" they call me the exterminator. at one brief point of intersection i did exercise that function and witnessed the belly dance of roaches suffocating in yellow pyretheum powder (\"hard to get now, lady... war on. let you have a little.... two dollars.\") sluiced fat bedbugs from rose wall paper in shabby theatrical hotels on north clark and poisoned the purposeful rat, occasional eater of human babies. wouldn't you? my present assignment: find the live ones and exterminate. not the bodies but the \"molds,\" you understand -- but i forget that you cannot understand. we have all but a very few. but even one could upset our food tray. the danger, as always, comes from defecting agents: a.j., the vigilante, the black armadillo (carrier of chagas vectors, hasn't taken a bath since the argentine epidemic of '35, remember? ), and lee and the sailor and benway. and i know some agent is out there in the darkness looking for me. because all agents defect and all resisters sell out....  \f",

      "105  hauser and o'brien when they walked in on me that morning at 8 o'clock, i knew it was my last chance, my only chance. but they didn't know. how could they? just a routine pick-up. but not quite routine. hauser had been eating breakfast when the lieutenant called: \"i want you and your partner to pick up a man named lee, william lee, on your way downtown. he's in the hotel lamprey. 103 just off b way.\" \"yeah i know where it is. i remember him too.\" \"good. room 606. just pick him up. don't take time to shake the place down. except bring in all books, letters, manuscripts. anything printed, typed or written. ketch?\" \"ketch. but what's the angle.... books... \" \"just do it.\" the lieutenant hung up. hauser and o'brien. they had been on the city narcotic squad for 20 years. old timers like me. i been on the junk for 16 years. they weren't bad as laws go. at least o'brien wasn't. o'brien was the con man, and hauser the tough guy. a vaudeville team. hauser had a way of hitting you before he said anything just to break the ice. then o'brien gives you an old gold -- just like a cop to smoke old golds somehow... and starts putting down a cop con that was really bottled in bond. not a bad guy, and i didn't want to do it. but it was my only chance. i was just tying up for my morning shot when they walked in with a pass key. it was a special kind you can use even when the door is locked from the inside with a key in the lock. on the table in front of me was a packet of junk, spike, syringe -- i got the habit of using a regular syringe in mexico and never went back to using a dropper -- alcohol, cotton and a glass of water. \"well well,\" says o'brien.... \"long time no see eh?\" \"put on your coat, lee,\" says hauser. he had his gun out. he always has it out when he makes a pinch for the psychological effect and to forestall a rush for toilet, sink or window. \"can i take a bang first, boys?\" i asked.... \"there's plenty here for evidence....\" i was wondering how i could get to my suitcase if they said no. the case wasn't locked, but hauser had the gun in his hand. \"he wants a shot,\" said hauser. \"now you know we can't do that, bill,\" said o'brien in his sweet con voice, dragging out the name with an oily, insinuating familiarity, brutal and obscene. he meant, of course, \"what can you do for us, bill?\" he looked at me and smiled. the smile stayed there too long, hideous and naked, the smile of an old painted pervert, gathering all the negative evil of o'brien's ambiguous function. \"i might could set up marty steel for you,\" i said. i knew they wanted marty bad. he'd been pushing for five years, and they couldn't hang one on him. marty was an oldtimer, and very careful about who he served. he had to know a man and know him well before he would pick up his money. no one can say they ever did time because of me. my rep is perfect, but still marty wouldn't serve me because he didn't know me long enough. that's how skeptical marty was. \"marty?\" said o'brien. \"can you score from him?\" \"sure i can.\" they were suspicious. a man can't be a cop all his life without developing a special set of intuitions. \"o.k.,\" said hauser finally. \"but you'd better deliver, lee.\" \"i'll deliver all right. believe me i appreciate this.\" i tied up for a shot, my hands trembling with eagerness, an archetype dope fiend.  \f",
      "106  \"just an old junky, boys, a harmless old shaking wreck of a junky.\" that's the way i put it down. as i had hoped, hauser looked away when i started probing for a vein. it's a wildly unpretty spectacle. o'brien was sitting on the arm of a chair smoking an old gold, looking out the window with that dreamy what i'll do when i get my pension look. i hit a vein right away. a column of blood shot up into the syringe for an instant sharp and solid as a red cord. i pressed the plunger down with my thumb, feeling the junk pound through my veins to feed a million junk-hungry cells, to bring strength and alertness to every nerve and muscle. they were not watching me. i filled the syringe with alcohol. hauser was juggling his snub-nosed detective special, a colt, and looking around the room. he could smell danger like an animal with his left hand he pushed the closet door open and glanced inside. my stomach contracted. i thought, \"if he looks in the suitcase now i'm done.\" hauser turned to me abruptly. \"you through yet?\" he snarled. \"you'd better not try to shit us on marty.\" the words came out so ugly he surprised and shocked himself. i picked up the syringe full of alcohol, twisting the needle to make sure it was tight. \"just two seconds,\" i said. i squirted a thin jet of alcohol, whipping it across his eyes with a sideways shake of the syringe. he let out a bellow of pain. i could see him pawing at his eyes with the left hand like he was tearing off an invisible bandage as i dropped to the floor on one knee, reaching for my suitcase. i pushed the suitcase open, and my left hand closed over the gun butt -- i am righthanded but i shoot with my left hand. i felt the concussion of hauser's shot before i heard it. his slug slammed into the wall behind me. shooting from the floor, i snapped two quick shots into hauser's belly where his vest had pulled up showing an inch of white shirt. he grunted in a way i could feel and doubled forward. stiff with panic, o'brien's hand was tearing at the gun in his shoulder holster. i clamped my other hand around my gun wrist to steady it for the long pull -- this gun has the hammer fled off round so you can only use it double action -- and shot him in the middle of his red forehead about two inches below the silver hairline. his hair had been grey the last time i saw him. that was about 15 years ago. my first arrest. his eyes went out. he fell off the chair onto his face. my hands were already reaching for what i needed, sweeping my notebooks into a briefcase with my works, junk, and a box of shells. i stuck the gun into my belt, and stepped out into the corridor putting on my coat. i could hear the desk clerk and the bell boy pounding up the stairs. i took the self-service elevator down, walked through the empty lobby into the street. it was a beautiful indian summer day. i knew i didn't have much chance, but any chance is better than none, better than being a subject for experiments with st (6) or whatever the initials are. i had to stock up on junk fast. along with airports, r.r. stations and bus terminals, they would cover all junk areas and connections. i took a taxi to washington square, got out and walked along 4th street till i spotted nick on a corner. you can always find the pusher. your need conjures him up like a ghost. \"listen, nick,\" i said, \"i'm leaving town. i want to pick up a piece of h. can you make it right now?\" we were walking along 4th street. nick's voice seemed to drift into my consciousness from no particular place. an eerie, disembodied voice. \"yes, i think i can make it. i'll have to make a run uptown.\" \"we can take a cab.\" \"o.k., but i can't take you in to the guy, you understand.\" \"i understand. let's go.\" we were in the cab heading north. nick was talking in his bat, dead voice.  \f",
      "107  \"some funny stuff we're getting lately. it's not weak exactly.... i don't know.... it's different. maybe they're putting some synthetic shit in it.... dollies or something....\" \"what!!!? already?\" \"huh?... but this i'm taking you to now is o.k. in fact it's about the best deal around that i know of. . stop here.\" \"please make it fast,\" i said. \"it should be a matter of ten minutes unless he's out of stuff and has to make a run.... better sit down over there and have a cup of coffee.... this is a hot neighborhood.\" i sat down at a counter and ordered coffee, and pointed to a piece of danish pastry under a plastic cover. i washed down the stale rubbery cake with coffee, praying that just this once, please god, let him make it now, and not come back to say the man is all out and has to make a run to east orange or greenpoint. well here he was back, standing behind me. i looked at him, afraid to ask. funny, i thought, here i sit with perhaps one chance in a hundred to live out the next 24 hours -- i had made up my mind not to surrender and spend the next three or four months in death's waiting room. and here i was worrying about a junk score. but i only had about five shots left, and without junk i would be immobilized.... nick nodded his head. \"don't give it to me here,\" i said. \"let's take a cab.\" we took a cab and started downtown. i held out my hand and copped the package, then i slipped a fifty- dollar bill into nick's palm. he glanced at it and showed his gums in a toothless smile: \"thanks a lot.... this will put me in the clear...\" i sat back letting my mind work without pushing it. push your mind too hard, and it will fuck up like an overloaded switchboard, or turn on you with sabotage. and i had no margin for error. americans have a special horror of giving up control, of letting things happen in their own way without interference. they would like to jump down into their stomachs and digest the food and shovel the shit out. your mind will answer most questions if you learn to relax and wait for the answer. like one of those thinking machines, you feed in your question, sit back, and wait.... i was looking for a name. my mind was sorting through names, discarding at once f.l.-- fuzz lover, b.w.-- born wrong, n.c.b.c.-- nice cat but chicken; putting aside to reconsider, narrowing, sifting, feeling for the name, the answer. \"sometimes, you know, he'll keep me waiting three hours. sometimes i make it right away like this.\" nick had a deprecating little laugh that he used for punctuation. sort of an apology for talking at all in the telepathizing world of the addict where only the quantity factor -- how much $? how much junk? -- requires verbal expression. he knew and i knew all about waiting. at all levels the drug trade operates without schedule. nobody delivers on time except by accident. the addict runs on junk time. his body is his clock, and junk runs through it like an hourglass. time has meaning for him only with reference to his need. then he makes his abrupt intrusion into the time of others, and, like all outsiders, all petitioners, he must wait, unless he happens to mesh with non-junk time. \"what can i say to him? he knows i'll wait,\" nick laughed. i spent the night in the ever hard baths -- (homosexuality is the best all-around cover story an agent can use) -- where a snarling italian attendant creates such an unnerving atmosphere sweeping the dormitory with infra red see in the dark fieldglasses. (\"all right in the north east corner! i see you!\" switching on floodlights, sticking his head through trapdoors in the floor and wall of the private rooms, that many a queen has been carried out in a straitjacket.... )  \f",

      "117  appendix the british journal of addiction  vol.53, n°2  letter from a master addict to dangerous drugs  august 3rd, 1956. venice. dear doctor, thanks for your letter. i enclose that article on the effects of various drugs i have used. i do not know if it suitable for your publication. i have no objection to my name being used. no difficulty with drinking. no desire to use any drug. general health excellent. please give my regards to mr------. i use his system of exercises daily with excellent results. i have been thinking of writing a book on narcotic drugs if i could find a suitable collaborator to handle the technical end. yours, william burroughs the use of opium and opium derivatives leads to a state that defines limits and describes \"addiction\" – (the term is loosely used to indicate anything one is used to or wants. we speak of addiction to candy, coffee, tobacco, warm weather, television, detective stories, crossword puzzles). so misapplied the term loses any useful precision of meaning. the use of morphine leads to a metabolic dependence on morphine. morphine becomes a biologic need like water and the user may die if he is suddenly deprived of it. the diabetic will die without insulin, but he is not addicted to insulin. his need for insulin was not brought about by the use of insulin. he needs insulin to maintain a normal metabolism. the addict needs morphine to maintain a morphine metabolism, and so avoid the excruciatingly painful return to a normal metabolism. i have used a number of \"narcotic\" drugs over a period of twenty years. some of these drugs are addicting in the above sense. most are not: opiates. -- over a period of twelve years i have used opium, smoked and taken orally (injection in the skin causes abcesses. injection in the vein is unpleasant and perharps dangerous), heroin injected in skin, vein, muscle, sniffed (when no needle was available), morphine, dilaudid, pantopon, eukodol, paracodine, dionine, codeine, demerol, methodone. they are all habit-forming in varying degree. nor does it make much difference how the drug is administred, smoked, sniffed, injected, taken orally, inserted in rectal suppositories, the end result will be the same: addiction. and a smoking habit is as difficult to break as an intravenous injection habit. the concept that injection habits are particularly injurious derives from an irrational fear of needles – (\"injections poison the blood stream\" – as though the blood stream were any less poisoned by substances absorbed by the stomach, the lungs or the mucous membrane). demerol is probably less addicting than morphine. it is also less satisfying to the addict, and less effective as a pain killer. while a demerol habit is easier to  \f",
      "118  break than a morphine habit, demerol is certainly more injurious to the health and specifically to the nervous system. i once used demerol for three months and developed a number of distressing symptoms: trembling hands (with morphine my hands are always steady), progressive loss of coordination, muscular constractions, paranoid obsessions, fear of insanity. finally i developed an opportune intolerance for demerol – no doubt a measure of self preservation – and switched to methodone. immediately all my symptoms disappeared. i may add that demerol is quite as constiping as morphine, that it exerts an even more depressing effect on the appetite and the sexual functions, does not, however, contracts the pupils. i have given myself thousands of injections over a period of years with unsterilized, in fact dirty, needles and never sustained an infection until i used demerol. then i came down with a series of abcesses one of which had to be lanced and drained. in short demerol seems to me a more dangerous drug than morphine. methodone is completely satisfying to the addict, an excellent pain killer, at least as addicting as morphine. i have taken morphine for acute pain. any opiate that effectively relieves pain to an equal degree relieves withdrawal symptoms. the conclusion is obvious: any opiate that relieves pain is habit forming, and the more effectively it relieves pain the more habit forming it is. the habit forming molecule, and the pain killing molecule of morphine are probably identical, and the process by which morphine relieves pain is the same process that leads to tolerance and addiction. non habit forming morphine appears to be a latter day philosopher’s stone. on the other hand variations of apomorphine may prove extremely effective in controlling the withdrawal syndrome. but we should not expect this drug to be a pain killer as well. the phenomena of morphine addiction are well known and there is no reason to go over them here. a few points, it seems to me, have received insufficient attention: the metabolic incompatibility between and alcohol has been observed, but no one, so far as i know, has advanced an explanation. if a morphine addict drinks alcohol he experiences no agreeable or euphoric sensations. there is a feeling of slowly mounting discomfort. the alcohol seems to be short-circuited, perharps by the liver. i once attempted to drink in a state of incomplete recovery from an attack of jaundice (i was not using morphine at this time.) the metabolic sensation was identical. in one case the liver was partly out of action from jaundice, in the other preoccupied, literally, by a morphine metabolism. in neither case could it metabolize alcohol. if an alcoholic becomes addicted to morphine, morphine invariably and completely displaces alcohol. i have known several alcoholics who began using morphine.they were able to tolerate larges doses of morphine immediately (1 grain to a shot) without ill effects, and in a matter of days stopped taking alcohol.the reverse never occurs. the morphine addict can not tolerate alcohol when he is using morphine or suffering from morphine withdrawal. the ability to tolerate alcohol is a sure sign of disintoxication. in consequence alcohol can never be substituted for morphine directly. of course a disintoxicated addict may start drinking and become an alcoholic. during withdrawal the addict is acutely aware of his surroundings. sense impressions are sharpened to the point of hallucination. familiar objects seem to stir with a writhing furtive life. the addict is subject to a barrage of sensations external and visceral. he may experience flashes of beauty and nostalgia, but the overall impression is extremely painful – (possibly his sensations are painful because of their intensity. a pleasurable sensation may become intolerable after a certain intensity is reached.) i have noticed two special reactions to early withdrawal: (1) everything looks threatening; (2) mild paranoia. the doctors ans nurses appear as monsters of evil. in the course of several cures, i have felt myself surrounded by dangerous lunatics. i talked with one of dr. dent’s patients who had just undergone disintoxication for a pethidine habit. he reported an identical experience, told me that for 24 hours the nurses and the doctor \"seemed brutal and repugnant.\" and everything looked blue.  \f",
      "119  and i have talked with other addicts who experienced the same reactions. now the psychological basis for paranoid notions during withdrawal is obvious. the specific similarity of these reactions indicates a common metabolic origin. the similarity between withdrawal phenomena and certain states of drug intoxication is striking. hashish, bannisteria caapi (harmaline), peyote (mescaline) produce states of acute sensitivity, with hallucinatory viewpoint. everything looks alive. paranoid ideas are frequent. bannisteria caapi intoxication specifically reproduces the state of withdrawal. everything looks thrightening. paranoid ideas are marked, especially with overdose. after taking bannisteria caapi, i was convinced that the medicine man and his apprentice were conspiring to murder me. it seems that metabolic states of the body can reproduce the effects of various drugs. in the usa heroin addicts are receiving an involuntary reduction cure from the pushers who progressively dilute their wares with milk, sugar and barbiturates. as a result many of the addicts who seek treatment are lightly addicted so they can be completely disintoxicated in a short time (7 to 8 days). they recover rapidly without medication. meanwhile any tranquil-lizing, anti-allergic or sedative drug, will afford some relief, especially if injected. the addict feels better if he knows that some alien substance is coursing through his blood stream. tolserol, thorazine and related \"tranquillizers,\" every variety of barbiturate, chloral and paraldehyde, antihistamines, cortisone, reserpine, even shock (can lobotomy be far behind?) have all been used with results usually described as \"encouraging.\" my own experience suggests that these results be accepted with some reserve. of course, symptomatic treatment is indicated, and all these drugs (with possible exception of the drug most commonly used: barbiturates) have a place in the treatment of the withdrawal syndrome. but none of these drugs is in itself the answer to withdrawal. withdrawal symptoms vary with individual metabolism and physical type. pigeon chested, hay fever and asthma liable individuals suffer greatly from allergic symptoms during withdrawal: running nose, sneezing, smarting, watering eyes, difficulty in breathing. in such cases cortisone and antihistamine drugs may afford definite relief. vomiting could probably be controlled with anti-nausea drugs like thorazine. i have undergone ten \"cures\" in the course of which all these drugs were used. i have taken quick reductions, slow reductions, prolonged sleep, apomorphine, antihistamines, a french system involving a worthless product known as \"amorphine,\" everything but shock. (i would be interested to hear results of further experiments with shock treatment on somebody else.) the success of any treatment depends on the degree and duration of addiction, the stage of withdrawal (drugs which are effective in late or light withdrawal can be disastrous in the acute phase), individual symptoms, health, age, etc. a method of treatment might be completely ineffective at one time, but give excellent results at another. or a treatment that does me no good may help someone else. i do not presume to pass any final judgements, only to report my own reactions to various drugs and methods of treatment. reduction cures. – this is the commonest form of treatment, and no method yet discovered can entirely replace it in cases of severe addiction. the patient must have some morphine. if there is one rule that applies to all cases of addiction this is it. but the morphine should be withdrawn as quickly as possible. i have taken slow reduction cures and in every case the result was discouragement and eventual relapse. imperceptible reduction is likely to be endless reduction. when the addict seeks cure, he has, in most cases, already experienced withdrawal symptoms many times. he expects an unpleasant ordeal and he is prepared to endure it. but if the pain of withdrawal is spread over two months instead of ten days he may not be able to endure it. it is not the intensity but the duration of pain than breaks the will to resist. if opiate to alleviate the weakness, insomnia, boredom, restlessness, of late withdrawal, the withdrawal symptoms will be prolonged indefinitely and complete relapse is almost certain.  \f",
      "120  prolonged sleep. – the theory sounds good. you go to sleep and wake up cured. industrial doses of chloral hydrate, barbiturates, thorazine, only produced a nightmare state of semiconsciousness. withdrawal of sedation, after 5 days, occasioned a severe shock. symptoms of acute morphine deprivation supervened. the end result was a combined syndrome of unparalleled horror. no cure i even took was as painful as this allegedly painless method. the cycle of sleep and wakefulness is always deeply disturbed during withdrawal. to further disturb it with massive sedation seems contraindicated to say the least. withdrawal of morphine is sufficiently traumatic without adding to it withdrawal of barbiturates. after two weeks in the hospital (five days sedation, ten days \"rest\"), i was still so weak that i fainted when i tried to walk up a slight incline. i consider prolonged sleep the worst possible method of treating withdrawal. antihistamines. – the use of antihistamines is based on the allergic theory of withdrawal. sudden withdrawal of morphine precipitates an overproduction of histamine with consequent allergic symptoms. (in shock resulting from traumatic injury with acute pain large quantities of histamine are released in the blood. in acute pain as in addiction toxic doses of morphine are readily tolerated. rabbits, who have a high histamine content in the blood, are extremely resistant to morphine.) my own experience with antihistamines has not been conclusive. i once took a cure in which only antihistamines were used, and the results were good. but i was lightly addicted at the time, and had been without morphine for 72 hours when the cure started. i have frequently used antihistamines since then for withdrawal symptoms with disappointing results. in fact they seem to increase my depression and irritability (i do not suffer from typical allergic symptoms). apomorphine. – apomorphine is certainly the best method of treating withdrawal that i have experienced. it does not completely eliminate the withdrawal symptoms, but reduces them to an endurable level. the acute symptoms such as stomach and leg cramps, convulsive or maniac states are completely controlled. in fact apomorphine treatment involves less discomfort than a reduction cure. recovery is more rapid and more complete. i feel that i was never completely cured of the craving for morphine until i took apomorphine treatment. perhaps the \"psychological\" craving for morphine that persists after a cure is not psychological at all, but metabolic. more potent variations of the apomorphine formula might prove qualitatively more effective in treating all forms of addiction. cortisone. – cortisone seems to give some relief especially when injected intravenously. thorazine. – provides some relief from withdrawal symptoms, but not much. side effects of depression, disturbance of vision, indigestion offset dubious benefits. reserpine. – i never noticed any effect whatever from this drug except a slight depression. tolserol. – negligible results. barbiturates. – it is common practice to prescribe barbiturates for the insomnia of withdrawal. actually the use of barbiturates delays the return of normal sleep, prolongs the whole period of withdrawal, and may lead to relapse. (the addict is tempted to take a little codeine or paregoric with his nembutal. very small quantities of opiates, that would be quite innocuous for a normal person, immediately re-establish addiction in a cured addict.) my experience certainly confirms dr. dent’s statement that barbiturates are contraindicated. chloral and paraldehyde. – probably preferable to barbiturates if a sedative is necessary, but most addicts will vomit up paraldehyde at once. i have also tried, on my own initiative, the following drugs during withdrawal alcohol. – absolutely contraindicated at any stage of withdrawal. the use of alcohol invariably exacerbates the withdrawal symptoms and leads to relapse. alcohol can only be tolerated after metabolism returns to normal. this usually takes one month in cases of severe addiction.  \f",
      "121  benzedrine. – may relieve temporarily the depression of late withdrawal, disastrous during acute withdrawal, contraindicated at any stage because it produces a state of nervousness for which morphine is the physiological answer. cocaine. – the above goes doubles for cocaine. cannabis indica (marijuana). -- :in late or light withdrawal relieves depression and increases the appetite, in acute withdrawal an unmitigated disaster. (i once smoked marijuana during early withdrawal with nightmarish results.) cannabis is a sensitizer. if you feel bad already it will make you feel worse. contraindicated. peyote, bannisteria caapi. i have not ventured to experiment. the thought of bannisteria intoxication superimposed on acute withdrawal makes the brain reel. i know of a man who substituted peyote during late withdrawal, claimed to lose all desire for morphine, ultimately died of peyote poisoning. in cases of severe addiction, definite, physical, withdrawal symptoms persist for one month at least. i have never seen or heard of a psychotic morphine addict, i mean anyone who showed psychotic symptoms while addicted to an opiate. in fact addicts are drearily sane. perhaps there is a metabolic incompatibility between schizophrenia and opiate addiction. on the other hand the withdrawal of morphine often precipitates psychotic reactions – usually mild paranoia. interestting that drugs and methods of treatment that give results in schizophrenia are also of some use in withdrawal: antihistamines, tranquillizers, apomorphine, shock. sir charles sherington defines pain as \"the psychic adjunct of an imperative protective reflex.\" the vegetative nervous system expands and contracts in response to visceral rhythms and external stimuli, expanding to stimuli which are experienced as pleasurable – sex, food, agreeable social contacts, etc. – contracting from pain, anxiety, fear, discomfort, boredom. morphine alters the whole cycle of expansion and contraction, release and tension. the sexual function is deactivated, peristalsis inhibited, the pupils cease to react in response to light and darkness. the organism neither contracts from pain nor expands to normal sources of pleasure. it adjusts to a morphine cycle. the addict is immune to boredom. he can look at his shoe for hours or simply stay in bed. he needs no sexual outlet, no social contacts, no work, no diversion, no exercise, nothing but morphine. morphine may relieve pain by imparting to the organism some of the qualities of a plant. (pain could have no function for plants which are, for the most part, stationary, incapable of protective reflexes.) scientists look for a non-habit forming morphine that will kill pain without giving pleasure, addicts want – or think they want – euphoria without addiction. i do not see how the functions of morphine can be separated, i think that any effective pain killer will depress the sexual function, induce euphoria and cause addiction. the perfect pain killer would probably be immediately habit forming. (if anyone is interested to develop such a drug, dehydro-oxy-heroin might be a good place to start.) the addict exists in a painless, sexless, timeless state. transition back to the rhythms of animal life involves the withdrawal syndrome. i doubt if this transition can ever be made in comfort. painless wihdrawal can only be approached. cocaine. – cocaine it the most exhilarating drug i have ever used. the euphoria centres in the head. perhaps the drug activates pleasure connections directly in the brain. i suspect that an electric current in the right place would produc the same effect. the full exhilaration of cocaine can only be realized by an intravenous injection. the pleasurable effects do not last more than five or ten minutes. if the drug is injected in the skin, rapid elimination vitiate the effects. this goes double for sniffing.  \f",
      "122  it is standard practice for cocaine users to sit up all night shooting cocaine at one minute intervals, alternating with shots of heroin mixed in the same injection to form a \"speed ball.\" (i have never known an habitual cocaine user who was not a morphine addict.) the desire for cocaine can be intense. i have spent whole days walking from one drug store to another to fill a cocaine prescription. you may want cocaine intensely, but you don’t have any metabolic need for it. if you can’t get cocaine you eat, you go to sleep and forget it. i have talked with people who used cocaine for years, then were suddenly cut off from their supply. none of them experienced any withdrawal symptoms. indeed it is difficult to see how a front brain stimulant could be addicting. addiction seems to be a monopoly of sedatives. continued use of cocaine leads to nervousness, depression, sometimes drug psychosis with paranoid hallucinations. the nervousness and depression resulting from cocaine use are not alleviated by more cocaine. they are effectively relieved by morphine. the use of cocaine by a morphine addict always leads to larger and more frequent injections of morphine. cannabis indica (hashish, marijuana). – the effects of this drug have been frequently and luridly described: disturbance of space-time perception, acute sensitivity to impressions, flights of ideas, laughing jags, silliness. marijuana is a sensitizer, and the results are not always pleasant. it makes a bad situation worse. depression vecomes despair, anxiety panic. i have already mentioned my horrible experience with marijuana during acute morphine withdrawal. i once gave marijuana to a guest who was mildly anxious about something (\"on bum kicks\" as he put it.) after smoking half a cigarette he suddenly leapt to his feet screaming \"i got the fear!\" and rushed out of the house. an especially unnerving feature of marijuana intoxication is a disturbance of the affective orientation. you do not know whether you like something or not, whether a sensation is pleasant or unpleasant. the use of marijuana varies greatly with the individual. some smoke it constantly, some occasionally, not a few dislike it intensely. it seems to be especially unpopular with confirmed morphine addicts, many of whom take a puritanical view of marijuana smoking. the ill effects of marijuana have been grossly exaggerated in the u.s. our national drug is alcohol. we tend to regard the use of any other drug with special horror. anyone given to these alien vices deserves the complete ruin of his mind and body. people believe what they want to believe without regard for the facts. marijuana is not habit forming. i have never seen evidence of any ill effects from moderate use. drug psychosis may result from prolonged and excessive use. barbiturates. – the barbiturates are definitely addicting if taken in large quantities over any period of time (about a gramme a day will cause addiction.) withdrawal syndrome is more dangerous than morphine withdrawal, consisting of hallucinations with epilepsy type convulsions. addicts often injure themselves flopping about on concrete floors (concrete floors being a usual corollary of abrupt withdrawal). morphine addicts often take barbiturates to potentiate inadequate morphine rations. some of them become barbiturate addicts as well. i once took two nembutal capsules (one and half grains each) every night for four months and suffered no withdrawal symptoms. barbiturate addiction is a question of quantity. it is probably not a metabolic addiction like morphine, but a mechanical reaction from excessive front brain sedation. the barbiturate addict presents a shocking spectacle. he can not coordinate, he staggers, falls off bar stools, goes to sleep in the middle of a sentence, drops food out of his mouth. he is confused, quarrelsome and stupid. and he almost always uses other drugs, anything he can lay hands on: alcohol, benzedrine, opiates, marijuana. barbiturate users are looked down on in addict society.  \f",
      "123  \"goof ball bums. they got no class to them.\" the next step down is coal gas and milk, or sniffing ammonia in a bucket – \"the scrub woman’s kick\" it seems to me that barbiturates cause the worst possible form of addiction, unsightly, deteriorating, difficult to treat. benzedrine. – this is a cerebral stimulant like cocaine. large doses cause prolonged sleeplessness with feelings of exhilaration. the period of euphoria is followed by a horrible depression. the drug tends to increase anxiety. it causes indigestion and loss of appetite. i know of only one case where definite symptoms followed the withdrawal of benzedrine. this was a woman of my acquaintance who used incredible quantities of benzedrine for six months. .during this period she developed a drug psychosis and was hospitalized for ten days. she continued the use of benzedrine, but was suddenly cut off. she suffered an asthma type seizure. she could not get her breath and turned blue. i gave her a dose of antihistamine (thepherene) which afforded immediate relief. the symptoms did not return. peyote (mescaline). this is undoubtedly a stimulant. it dilates the pupils, keeps one awake. peyote is extremely nauseating. users experience difficulty keeping it down long enough to realize the effect, which is similar, in some respects, to marijuana. there is increased sensitivity to impression, especially to colours. peyote intoxication causes a peculiar vegetable consciousness or identification with the plant. everything looks like a peyote plant. it is easy to understand why the indians believe there is a resident spirit in the peyote cactus. overdose of peyote may lead to respiratory paralysis and death. i know of one case. there is no reason to believe that peyote is addicting. bannisteria caapi (harmaline, banisterine, telepathine). bannisteria caapi is a fast growing vine. the active principle is apparently found throughout the wood of the fresh cut vine. the inner bark is considered most active, and the leaves are never used. it takes a considerable quantity of the vine to feel the full effects of the drug. about fives pieces of vine each eight inches long are needed for one person. the vine is crushed and boiled for two or more hours with the leaves of a bush identified as palicourea sp. rubiacea. yage or ayuahuaska (the most commonly used indian names for bannisteria caapi) is a hallucinating narcotic that produces a profound derangement of the senses. in overdose it is a convulsant poison. the antidote is a barbiturate or other strong, anti-convulsant sedative. anyone taking yage for the first time should have a sedative ready in the event of an overdose. the hallucinating properties of yage have led to its use by medicine men to potentiate their powers. they also use it as a cure-all in the treatment of various illnesses. yage lowers the body temperature and consequently is of some use in the treatment of fever. it is a powerful antihelminthic, indicated for the treatment of stomach or intestinal worms. yage induces a state of conscious anaesthesia, and is used in rites where the initiates must undergo a painful ordeal like whipping with knotted vines, or exposer to the sting of ants. so far as i could discover only the fresh cut vine is active. i found no way to dry, extract or preserve the active principal. no tinctures proved active. the dried vine is completely inert. the pharmacology of yage requires laboratory research. since the crude extract is such a powerful,  \f",
      "124  hallucinating narcotic, perphaps even more spectacular results could be obtained with synthetic variations. certainly the matter warrants further research* i did not observe any ill effects that could be attributed to the use of yage. the medicine men who use it continuously in line of duty seem to enjoy normal health. tolerance is soon acquired so that one can drink the extract without nausea or other ill effect. yage is a unique narcotic. yage intoxication is in some respects similar to intoxication with hashish. in both instances there is a shift of viewpoint, an extension of consciousness beyond ordinary experience. but yage produces a deeper derangement of the senses with actual hallucinations. blue flashes in front of the eyes is peculiar to yage intoxication. there is a wide range of attitude in regard to yage. many indians and most white users seem to regard it simply as another intoxicant like liquor. in other groups it has ritual use and significance. among the jivaros, young men take yage to contact the spirits of their ancestors and get a briefing for their future life. it is used during initiations to anaesthetize the initiates for painful ordeals. all medicine men use it in their practice to foretell the future, locate lost or stolen objects, name the perpretator of a crime, to diagnose and treat illness. the alkaloid of bannisteria caapi was isolated in 1923 by fisher cardenas. he called the alkaloid telepathine, alternately banisterine. rumf showed that telepathine was identical with harmine, the alkaloid of perganum harmala. bannisteria is evidently not habit forming. nutmeg. – convicts and sailors sometimes have recourse to nutmeg. about a tablespoon is swallowed with water. results are vaguely similar to marijuana with side effects of headache and nausea. death would probably supervene before addiction if such addiction is possible. i have only taken nutmeg once. there are a number of narcotics of the nutmeg family in use among the indians of south america. they are usually administered by sniffing a dried powder of the plant. the medicine men take these noxious substances, and go into convulsive states. their twitchings and mutterings are thought to have prophetic significance. a friend of mine was violently sick for three days after experimenting with a drug of the nutmeg family in south america. datura-scopolamine. morphine addicts are frequently poisoned by taking morphine in combination with scopolamine. i once obtained some ampoules, each of which contained one-sixth grain of morphine and onehundredth grain of scopolamine. thinking that one-hundredth grain was a negligible quantity, i took six ampoules in one injection. the result was a psychotic state lasting some hours during which i was opportunely restrained by my long suffering landlord. i remembered nothing the following day. drugs of the datura group are used by the indians of south america. fatalities are said to be frequent. scopolamine has been used by the russians as a confession drug with dubious results. the subject may be willing to reveal his secrets, but quite unable to remember them. often cover story and secret information are inextricably garbled. i understand that mescaline has been very successful in extracting information from suspects.  *  since this was published i have discovered that the alkaloids of bannisteria caapi are closely related to lsd6 which has been used to produce experimental psychosis. i think they are up to lsd25 already.  \f",
      "125  morphine addiction is a metabolic illness brought about by the use of morphine. in my opinion psychological treatment is not only useless it is contraindicated. statistically the people who become addicted to morphine are those who have access to it: doctors, nurses, anyone in contact with black market sources. in persia where opium is sold without control in opium shops, 70 per cent of the adult population is addicted. so we should psycho-analyze several millions persians to find out what deep conflicts and anxieties have driven them to the use of opium? i think not. according to my experience most addicts are not neurotic and do not need psychotherapy. apomorphine treatment and access to apomorphine in the event of relapse would certainly give a higher percentage of permanent cures than any programme of \"psychological rehabilitation.\"\f",
