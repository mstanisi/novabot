TVVILIGHT'S LAST
GLEAMINGS
PLEASE IMAGINE AN EXPLOSION ON A SHIP
A paretic named Perkins sat askew on his broken wheelchair.
He arranged his lips.
"You pithyathed thon of a bidth!" he shouted.

Barbara Cannon, a second-class passenger, lay naked in a first­
class bridal suite with Stewart Lindy Adams. Lindy got out of bed
and walked over to a window and looked out.

"Put on your clothes, honey," he said. "There's been an
accident. "
A first-class passenger named Mrs. Norris was thrown out of
bed by the explosion. She lay there shrieking until her maid came
and helped her up.
"Bring me my wig and my kimono," she told the maid. "I'm
going to see the captain. "

Dr. Benway, ship's doctor, drunkenly added two inches to a
four-inch incision with one stroke of his scalpel.
"There was a little scar, Doctor," said the nurse, who was peering
over his shoulder. "Perhaps the appendix is already out . "
"The appendix out!" the doctor shouted. "I'm taking the ap­
pendix out! What do you think I'm doing here?"
"Perhaps the appendix is on the left side," said the nurse. "That
happens sometimes, you know. "
"Can't you be quiet?" said the doctor. "I'm coming to that!" He
threw back his elbows in a movement of exasperation. "Stop breath­
ing down my neck!" he yelled. He thrust a red fist at her. "And
get me another scalpel. This one has no edge to it. "
He lifted the abdominal wall and searched along the incision.
"I know where an appendix is. I studied appendectomy in 1904
at Harvard . "
The floor tilted from the force of the explosion. The doctor reeled
back and hit the wall.
"Sew her up!" he said, peeling off his gloves. "I can't be ex­
pected to work under such conditions!"

At a table in the bar sat Christopher Hitch, a rich liberal; Colonel
Merrick, retired; Billy Hines of Newport; and Joe Bane, writer.

"In all my experience as a traveler," the Colonel was saying,
"I have never encountered such service . "
Billy Hines twisted h i s glass, watching the ice cubes. "Frightful
service, " he said, his face contorted by a suppressed yawn.
"Do you think the captain controls this ship?" said the Colonel,
fixing Christopher Hitch with a bloodshot blue eye. "Unions!"
shouted the Colonel. "Unions control this ship!"
Hitch gave out with a laugh that was supposed to be placating
but ended up oily. "Things aren't so bad, really," he said, patting
at the Colonel's arm. He didn't land the pat, because the Colonel
drew his arm out of reach. "Things will adjust themselves. "
Joe Bane looked up from his drink of straight rye. "It's like I
say, Colonel, " he said. "A man-"
The table left the floor and the glasses crashed. Billy Hines
remained seated, looking blankly at the spot where his glass had
been. Christopher Hitch rose uncertainly. Joe Bane jumped up
and ran away.
"By God!" said the Colonel. "I'm not surprised!"

Also at a table in the bar sat Philip Bradshinkel, investment
banker; his wife, Joan Bradshinkel; Branch Morton, a St. Louis
politician; and �lorton's wife, Mary �lorton. The explosion knocked
their table over.
Joan raised her eyebrows in an expression of sour annoyance.
She looked at her husband and sighed.
"I'm sorry this happened, dear, " said her husband. "Whatever
it is, I mean. "
Mary Morton said, "Well, I declare!"
Branch Morton stood up, pushing back his chair with a large
red hand. "Wait here," he said. "I'll find out . "

Mrs. Norris pushed through a crowd on C Deck. She rang the
elevator bell and waited. She rang again and waited. After five
minutes she walked up to A Deck.

The Negro orchestra, high on marijuana, remained seated after
the explosion. Branch Morton walked over to the orchestra leader.
"Play 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' " he ordered.
The orchestra leader looked at him.
"What you say?" he asked.
"You black baboon, play 'The Star-Spangled Banner' on your
horn !"
"Contract don't say nothing 'bout no Star-Spangled Banner,"
said a thin Negro in spectacles.
"This old boat am swinging on down !" someone in the orchestra
yelled, and the musicians jumped down off the platform and scat­
tered among the passengers.
Branch Morton walked over to a jukebox in a comer of the
saloon. He saw "The Star-Spangled Banner" by Fats Waller. He
put in a handful of quarters. The machine clicked and buzzed and
began to play:
"OH SAY CAN YOU? YES YES"

Joe Bane fell against the door of his stateroom and plunged in.
He threw himself on the bed and drew his knees up to his chin.
He began to sob.
His wife sat on the bed and talked to him in a gentle hypnotic
voice. "You can't stay here, Joey. This bed is going underwater.
You can't stay here."
Gradually the sobbing stopped and Bane sat up. She helped him
put on a life belt. "Corne along," she said.

"Yes, honey face , " he said, and followed her out the door.
"AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE"

Mrs. Norris found the door to the captain's cabin aJar. She
pushed it open and stepped in, knocking on the open door. A tall,
thin, red-haired man with horn-rimmed glasses was sitting at a
desk littered with maps. He glanced up without speaking.
"Oh Captain, is the ship sinking? Someone set off a bomb, they
said. I'm Mrs. Norris-you know, Mr. Norris, shipping business.
Oh the ship is sinking! I know, or you'd say something. Captain,
you will take care of us? My maid and me?" She put out a hand
to touch the captain's ann. The ship listed suddenly, throwing her
heavily against the desk. Her wig slipped.
The captain stood up. He snatched the wig off her head and
put it on.
"Give me that kimono!" he ordered.
Mrs. Norris screamed. She started for the door. The captain
took three long, springy strides and blocked her way. Mrs. Norris
rushed for a window, screaming. The captain took a revolver from
his side pocket. He aimed at her bald pate outlined in the window,
and fired.
"You Goddamned old fool," he said. "Give me that kimono!"

Philip Bradshinkel walked up to a sailor with his affable smile.
"Room for the ladies on this one?" he asked, indicating a
lifeboat.
The sailor looked at him sourly.
"No!" said the sailor. He turned away and went on working on
the launching davit.
"Now wait a minute ," said Bradshinkel. "You can't mean that.
Women and children first, you know."

"Nobody goes on this lifeboat but the crew," said the sailor.
"Oh, I understand," said Bradshinkel, pulling out a wad of bills.
The sailor snatched the money.
"I thought so," said Bradshinkel. He took his wife by the arm
and started to help her into the lifeboat.
"Get that old meat outa here!" screamed the sailor.
, "But you made a bargain! You took my money!"
"Oh for Chrissakes, " said the sailor. "I just took your dough so
it wouldn't get wet!"
"But my wife is a woman!"
Suddenly the sailor became very gentle.
"All my life," he said, "all my life I been a sucker for a classy
dame. I seen 'em in the Sunday papers laying on the beach. Soft
messy tits. They just lay there and smile dirty. Jesus they heat my
pants!"
Bradshinkel nudged his wife. "Smile at him . " He winked at the
sailor. "What do you say?"
"Naw," said the sailor, "I ain't got time to lay her now. "
"Later," said Bradshinkel.
"Later's no good. Besides she's special built for you. She can't
give me no kids and she drinks alla time. Like I say, I just seen
her in the Sunday papers and wanted her like a dog wants rotten
meat. "
"Let me talk to this man," said Branch Morton. He worked his
fingers over the fleshy shoulder of his wife and pulled her under
his armpit.
"This little woman is a mother," he said. The sailor blew his
nose on the deck. Morton grabbed the sailor by the biceps.
"In Clayton, Missouri , seven kids whisper her name through
their thumbs before they go to sleep. "
The sailor pulled his arm free. Morton dropped both hands to
his sides, palms facing forward.
"As man to man, " he was p1ead'mg. "A s man to man. "

Two Negro musicians, their eyes gleaming, came up behind the
two wives. One took Mrs. Morton by the arm, the other took Mrs.
Bradshinkel.
"Can us have dis dance witchu?"
"THAT OUR FLAG WAS STILL THERE"

Captain Kramer, wearing Mrs. Norris' kimono and wig, his face
heavily smeared with cold cream, and carrying a small suitcase,
walked down to C Deck, the kimono billowing out behind him.
He opened the side door to the purser's office with a pass key. A
thin-shouldered man in a purser's uniform was stuffing currency
and jewels into a suitcase in front of an open safe.
The captain's revolver swung free of his brassiere and he fired
twice.
"SO GALLANTLY STREAMING"

Finch, the radio operator, washed down bicarbonate of soda and
belched into his hand. He put the glass down and went on tapping
out S. O . S.
"S. O . S . . . . S. S. America . . . S. O . S . . . . off Jersey coast

Lifting his kimono with his left hand, the captain stepped in
behind the radio operator. He fired one shot into the back of Finch's
head. He shoved the small body aside and smashed the radio with
a chair.

Dr. Benway, carrying his satchel, pushed through the passengers
crowded around Lifeboat No. l.
"Are you all all right?" he shouted, seating himself among the
women. "I'm the doctor. "
"BY THE ROCKETS' RED GLARE"

When the captain reached Lifeboat No. l there were two seats
left. Some of the passengers were blocking each other as they tried
to force their way in, others were pushing forward a wife, a mother,
or a child. The captain shoved them all out of his way, leapt into
the boat and sat down. A boy pushed through the crowd in the
captain's wake.
"Please," he said. "I'm only thirteen. "
"Yes yes," said the captain, "you can sit by me. "
The boat started jerkily toward the water, lowered by four male
passengers. A woman handed her baby to the captain.
"Take care of my baby, for God's sake!"
Joe Bane landed in the boat and slithered noisily under a thwart.
Dr. Benway cast off the ropes. The doctor and the boy started to
row. The captain looked back at the ship.
"OH SAY CAN YOU SEE"

A third-year divinity student named Titman heard Perkins in
his stateroom, yelling for his attendant. H e opened the door and
looked in.
"What do you want, thicken thit?" said Perkins.
"I want to help you," said Titman.
"Thtick it up and thwitht it!" said Perkins.
"Easy does it," said Titman, walking over toward the broken
wheelchair. "Everything is going to be okey-dokey. "

10

Wil l i am S. Burrough•

"Thneaked off!" Perkins put a hand on one hip and jerked the
elbow forward in a grotesque indication of dancing. "Danthing with
floothies!"
"We'll find him," said Titman, lifting Perkins out of the wheel­
chair. He carried the withered body in his arms like a child. As
Titman walked out of the stateroom, Perkins snatched up a butcher
knife used by his attendant to make sandwiches.
"Danthing with floothies !"
"BY THE DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT"

A crowd of passengers was fighting around Lifeboat No. 7. It
was the last boat that could be launched. They were using bottles,
broken deck chairs and fire axes. Titman, carrying Perkins in his
arms, made his way through the fighting unnoticed. He placed
Perkins in a seat at the stern.
"There you are, " said Titman. "All set . "
Perkins said nothing. H e sat there, chin drawn back, eyes shin­
ing, the butcher knife clutched rigidly in one hand.
A hysterical crowd from second class began pushing from be­
hind. A big-faced shoe clerk with long yellow teeth grabbed Mrs.
Bane and shoved her forward. "Ladies first!" he yelled.
A wedge of men formed behind him and pushed. A shot sounded
and Mrs. Bane fell forward, hitting the lifeboat. The wedge broke,
rolling and scrambling. A man in an ROTC uniform with a . 45
automatic in his hand stood by the lifeboat. He covered the sailor
at the launching davit.
"Let this thing down!" he ordered.
As the lifeboat slid down toward the water, a cry went up from
the passengers on deck. Some of them jumped into the water,
others were pushed by the people behind.
"Let 'er go, God damn it, let 'er go!" yelled Perkins.
"Throw him out!"

A hand rose out of the water and closed on the side of the boat.
Springlike, Perkins brought the knife down. The fingers fell into
the boat and the bloody stump of hand slipped back into the water.
The man with the gun was standing in the stern. "Get going!"
he ordered. The sailors pulled hard on the oars.
Perkins worked feverishly, chopping on all sides. "Bathtardth,
thonthabitheth!" The swimmers screamed and fell away from the
boat.
"That a boy. "
"Don't let 'em swamp us."
"Atta boy, Comrade. "
"Bathtardth, thonthabitheth! Bathtardth, thonthabitheth!"

THE FINGER
Lee walked slowly up Sixth A venue from 42nd Street, looking in
pawnshop windows.
"I must do it," he repeated to himself.
Here it was. A cutlery store. He stood there shivering, with the
collar of his shabby chesterfield turned up. One button had fallen
off the front of his overcoat, and the loose threads twisted in a
cold wind. He moved slowly around the shopwindow and into the
entrance, looking at knives and scissors and pocket microscopes
and air pistols and take-down tool kits with the tools snapping or
screwing into a metal handle, the whole kit folding into a small

13

leather packet. Lee remembered getting one of these kits for Christ­
mas when he was a child.
Finally he saw what he was looking for: poultry shears like the
ones his father used to cut through the joints when he carved the
turkey at Grandmother's Thanksgiving dinners. There they were,
glittering and stainless, one blade smooth and sharp, the other
wi th teeth like a saw to hold the meat in place for cutting.
Lee went in and asked to see the shears. He opened and closed
the blades, tested the edge with his thumb.
"That's stainless steel, sir. Never rusts or tarnishes. "
"How much?''
"Two dollars and seventy-nine cents plus tax. "
"Okay . "
The clerk wrapped the shears in brown paper and taped the
package neatly. It seemed to Lee that the crackling paper made
a deafening noise in the empty store. He paid with his last five
dollars, and walked out with the shears heavy in his overcoat
pocket.
He walked up Sixth Avenue, repeating: "I must do it. I've got
to do it now that I've bought the shears." He saw a sign: Hotel
Aristo .
There was no lobby. He walked up a flight of stairs. An old
man, dingy and indistinct like a faded photograph, was standing
behind a desk. Lee registered, paid one dollar in advance, and
picked up a key with a heavy bronze tag.
His room opened onto a dark shaft. He turned on the light.
Black stained furniture, a double bed with a thin mattress and
sagging springs. Lee unwrapped the shears and held them in his
hand. He put the shears down on the dresser in front of an oval
mirror that turned on a pivot.
Lee walked around the room. He picked up the shears again
and placed the end joint of his left little finger against the saw
teeth, lower blade exactly at the knuckle. Slowly he lewered the

,4

Wlllla11'1 S. Burrough&

cutting blade until it rested against the flesh of his finger. He
looked in the mirror, composing his face into the supercilious mask
of an eighteenth-century dandy. He took a deep breath, pressed
the handle quick and hard. He felt no pain. The finger joint fell
on the dresser. Lee turned his hand over and looked at the stub.
Blood spurted up and hit him in the face. He felt a sudden deep
pity for the finger joint that lay there on the dresser, a few drops
of blood gathering around the white bone. Tears came to his eyes.
"It didn't do anything," he said in a broken child's voice. He
adjusted his face again, cleaned the blood off it with a towel, and
bandaged his finger crudely, adding more gauze as the blood soaked
through. In a few minutes the bleeding had stopped. Lee picked
up the finger joint and put it in his vest pocket. He walked out of
the hotel, tossing his key on the desk.
"I've done it," he said to himself. Waves of euphoria swept
through him as he walked down the street. He stopped in a bar
and ordered a double brandy, meeting all eyes with a level, friendly
stare. Goodwill flowed out of him for everyone he saw, for the whole
world. A lifetime of defensive hostility had fallen from him.
Half an hour later he was sitting with his analyst on a park
bench in Central Park. The analyst was trying to persuade him to
go to Bellevue, and had suggested they "go outside to talk it over. "
"Really, Bill, you're doing yourself a great disservice. When
you realize what you've done you'll need psychiatric care. Your
ego will be overwhelmed. "
"All I need i s to have this finger sewed up. I've got a date
tonight. "
"Really, Bill, I don't see how I can continue as your psychiatrist
if you don't follow my advice in this matter. " The analyst's voice
had become whiny, shrill, almost hysterical. Lee wasn't listening;
he felt a deep trust in the doctor. The doctor would take care of
him. He turned to the doctor with a little-boy smile.
"Why don't you fix it yourself?"

I NTERZO N E

1 15

"I haven't practiced since my internship, and I don't have the
necessary materials in any case. This has to be sewed up right,
or it could get infected right on up the arm."
Lee finally agreed to go to Bellevue, for medical treatment only.

' At Bellevue, Lee sat on a bench, waiting while the doctor talked
to somebody. The doctor came back and led Lee to another room,
where an intern sewed up the finger and put on a dressing. The
doctor kept urging him to allow himself to be committed; Lee was
overcome by a sudden faintness. A nurse told him to put his head
back. Lee felt that he must put himself entirely in the care of the
doctor.
"All right," he said. "I'll do what you say. "
The doctor patted his arm. "Ah, you're doing the right thing,
Bill. " The doctor led him past several desks, where he signed
papers.
"I'm cutting red tape by the yard," the doctor said.
Finally Lee found himself in a dressing gown in a bare ward.
"Where is my room?" he asked a nurse.
"Your room! I don't know what bed you've been assigned to.
Anyway you can't go there before eight unless you have a special
order from the doctor."
"Where is my doctor?"
"Doctor Bromfield? He isn't here now. He'll be m tomorrow
morning around ten. "
" I mean Doctor Horowitz. "
"Doctor Horowitz? I don't think he's on the staff here . "
H e looked around h i m at the bare corridors, the men walking
around in bathrobes, muttering under the cold, indifferent eyes of
an attendant.

Why, this is the psychopathic ward, he thought. He put me in
here and went away!

Years later, Lee would tell the story: "Did I ever tell you about
the time I got on a Van Gogh kick and cut off the end joint of my
little finger?" At this point he would hold up his left hand. "This
girl, see? She lives in the next room to me in a rooming house on
Jane Street. That's in the Village. I love her and she's so stupid
I can't make any impression. Night after night I lay there hearing
her carry on with some man in the next room. It's tearing me all
apart . . . . So I hit on this finger joint gimmick. I'll present it to
her: 'A trifling memento of my undying affection. I suggest you
wear it around your neck in a pendant filled with formaldehyde. '
"But my analyst, the lousy bastard, shanghaied me into the
nuthouse, and the finger joint was sent to Potter's Field with a
death certificate, because someone might find the finger joint and
the police go around looking for the rest of the body.
"If you ever have occasion to cut off a finger joint, my dear,
don't consider any instrument but poultry shears. That way you're
sure of cutting through at the joint. "
"And what about the girl?"
"Oh , by the time I got out of the nuthouse she'd gone to Chicago.
I never saw her again. "

DRIVING LESSON
The red-light district of East St. Louis is a string of wood houses
along the railroad tracks: a marginal district of vacant lots, decaying
billboards and cracked sidewalks where weeds grow through the
cracks. Here and there you see rows of com.
Bill and Jack were drinking in a bar on one comer of the district.
They had been drinking since early afternoon, and were past the
point of showing signs of drunkenness. Through the door, Bill
could hear frogs croaking from pools of stagnant water in the vacant
lots. Above the bar was a picture of Custer's Last Stand, distributed

18

by courtesy of Anheuser-Busch. Bill knew the picture was valuable,
like a wooden Indian. He was trying to explain this to the bartender,
how an object gets rare and then valuable, the value increasing
geometrically as collectors buy it up.
"Yeah , " the bartender said, "you already told me that ten times.
Anything else?" He walked to the other end of the bar and studied
a Racing Form, writing on a slip of paper with a short indelible
pencil.
Jack picked up a dollar of Bill's money off the bar. "I want to
go in one of these houses, " he said.
"All right . . . enjoy yourself. " Bill watched Jack as he walked
through the swinging door.

On the way back to St. Louis, Bill stopped the car.
"Want to try driving a bit?" he asked. "After all, you'll never
get anywhere sitting on your ass. I remember when I was a reporter
on the St . Louis News, my city editor sent me out to get a picture
of some character committed suicide or something. . . . I forget.
. . . Anyway, I couldn't get the picture. Some female relative came
to the door and said, 'It would be a mockery,' and they wouldn't
give me the picture.
"And next morning I went in the john and there is the city editor
taking his morning crap. So he asks me: 'You got that picture,
Morton?' And I said, 'No, I couldn't get it-at least not yet. '
" 'Well,' he says, 'you'll never get anywhere sitting on your ass. '
"So I start laughing, because that's exactly what h e is doing,
sitting on his ass, shitting. And I'll stack that up against any
biographical anecdote for tasteless stupidity. "
Jack looked at Bill blankly, and then laughed. The plain truth

is, he's bone stupid, Bill thought. He opened the door and got out
and walked around the car, through the headlights, and got in the

I NTERZ O N E

19

other side. Jack slid in under the wheel, looking dubiously at the
gadgets in front of him. He had only driven twice before in his
life, both times in Bill's car.
"Oh, it's quite simple, " Bill said. "You learn by doing. Could
you learn to play piano by reading a book about it? Certainly not. "
He suddenly took Jack's chin in his hand and, turning Jack's face,
kissed him lightly on the mouth. Jack laughed, showing sharp little
eyeteeth.
"I always say people have more fun than anybody," Jack said.
Bill shuddered in the summer night. "I suppose they do," he
said. "Well, let's get this show on the road. "
Jack started the car with a grinding of gears. The car bucked,
almost stopped, shot forward. Finally he got it in high and moving
at an even speed.
"You'll never learn this way," Bill said. "Let's see a little speed. "
I t was three o'clock in the morning. Not a car o n the street, not
a sound. A pocket of immobile silence.
"A little speed, Jackie. " Bill's voice was the eerie, disembodied
voice of a young child. "That thing under your foot-push it on
into the floor, Jackie. "
The car gathered speed, tires humming on asphalt. There was
no other sound from outside.
"We have the city all to ourselves, Jackie . . . not a car on the
street. Push it all the way down . . . all the way in . . . all the
way, Jackie."
Jack's face was blank, oblivious, the beautiful mouth a little
open. Bill lit a cigarette from the dashboard lighter, muttering a
denunciation of car lighters and car clocks. A piece of burning
tobacco fell on his thigh, and he brushed it away petulantly. He
looked at Jack's face and put the cigarettes away.
The car had moved into a dream beyond co�tact with the lives,
forces and objects of the city. They were alone, safe, floating in
the summer night, a moon spinning around the world. The dash-

20

William S. Burrougha

board shone like a fireplace, lighting the two young faces: one
weak and beautiful, with a beauty that would show every day that
much older; the other thin, intense, reflecting unmistakably the
qualities loosely covered by the word "intellectual, " at the same
time with the look of a tormented, trapped animal. The speedometer
crept up

.

.

.

50 . . . 60 . . .

"You're learning fast, Jackie. Just keep your right foot on the
floor. It's quite simple, really. "
Jack swerved to avoid the metal mounds of a safety zone. The
car hit a wet spot where the street had been watered and went into
a long skid. There was a squealing crash of metal. Bill flew out
of the car door and slid across the asphalt. He got up and ran his
hands over his thin body-nothing broken. Somebody was holding
his arm.
"Are you hurt, kid?"
"I don't think so. "
He remembered seeing his car hauled away by a wrecker, the
front wheels off the ground. He kept asking, "Where is Jack?"
Finally he saw Jack with two cops. Jack looked dazed. There was
a bruise on his forehead, standing out sharply on the white skin.
They rode in a police car to the hospital, where the doctor put
a patch on Jack's forehead. He found a cut on Bill's leg, and
swabbed it with Mercurochrome.
At the police station, Bill asked to call his father. It seemed to
Bill literally no time before his father appeared, conjured by an
alcoholic time trick. Suddenly there he was, cool and distant as
always, talking to the cops. They had hit a parked car. The owner
of the other car was there.
"So I met my wife at the train and took her to see the new car,
and there wasn't any car. All four wheels kryocked off. "
"That will all be taken care of," Mr. Morton told him.
"Well, I should think so. That car can't be fixed. There's nothing
left of it. "

I NTERZON E

21

"In that case you will get a new car. "
"Well, I should think so! People driving like that should be in
jail. Endangering people's lives!" He glared at Bill and Jack.
One of the cops looked at him coldly. "We'll decide who to put
in jail, mister. The gentleman is getting you a new car. What are
you kicking about?"
' "Well, so long as I get a new car. "
There was an exchange of cards and arrangements. The desk
sergeant accepted one of Mr. Morton's cigars and shook hands
with him. No one paid any attention to the owner of the other car.
Bill and Jack walked out of the station with Mr. Morton.
"Where do you want to be dropped oft?" Mr. Morton asked Jack.
Jack told him. He got out at his street, and Bill said, "Good night,
Jack. I'll give you a ring. "
Jack said, "Thank you, Mr. Morton. " Mr. Morton shifted his
cigar without answering. He put the car in gear and drove away.
It was a long ride to the Mortons' house in the suburbs. Father
and son rode in silence. Finally Bill said, "I'm sorry, Dad

.

. .

1-"
"So am I," his father cut in.
When they reached the garage door, Bill got out and opened it,
closing it again behind the car after Mr. Morton got out. Mr. Morton
opened the door with a key in a leather folder. They entered the
house in silence.
"It's all right, Mother," Mr. Morton called upstairs. "Nobody
hurt." He started toward the pantry. "Want some milk, Bill?"
"No, thanks, Dad. "
Bill went upstairs to bed.

CHR IST MAS
It was Christmas Day and Danny the Car Wiper hit the street junk­
sick and broke after seventy-two hours in the precinct jail. It was
a clear bright day, but there was no warmth in the sun. Danny
shivered with an inner cold. He turned up the collar of his worn,
greasy black overcoat.

This beat benny wouldn't pawn for a deuce, he thought.
He was in the West Nineties. A long block of brownstone rooming
houses. Here and there a holy wreath in a clean black window.
Danny's senses registered everything sharp and clear, with the

23

painful intensity of junk sickness. The light hurt his dilated eyes.
He walked past a car, darting his pale blue eyes sideways in
quick appraisal. There was a package on the seat and one of the
ventilator windows was unlocked. Danny walked on ten feet. No
one in sight. He snapped his fingers and went through a pantomime
of remembering something, and wheeled around. No one.

A bad setup, he decided. The street being empty like this, I stand
out conspicuous . Cotta make it fast .
He reached for the ventilator window. A door opened behind
him. Danny whipped out a rag and began polishing the car win­
dows. He could feel the man standing behind him.
"What're yuh doin'?"
Danny turned as if surprised. "Just thought your car windows
needed polishing, mister. "
The man had a frog face and a Deep South accent. He was
wearing a camel's-hair overcoat.
"My caah don't need polishin' or nothing stole out of it neither. "
Danny slid sideways as the man grabbed for him. "I wasn't
lookin' to steal nothing, mister. I'm from the South too. Florida-"
"Goddamned sneakin' thief!"
Danny walked away fast and turned a comer.

Better get out of the neighborhood . That hick is likely to call the
law .
He walked fifteen blocks. Sweat ran down his body. There was
a raw ache in his lungs. His lips drew back off his yellow teeth
in a snarl of desperation.

I gotta score somehow . If I had some decent clothes . . .
Danny saw a suitcase standing in a doorway. Good leather. He
stopped and pretended to look for a cigarette.
Funny, he thought. No one around. Inside maybe, phoning for
a cab .
The comer was only a few houses away. Danny took a deep

24

Wllllen1 S. Burrough•

breath and picked up the suitcase. He made the corner. Another
block, another comer. The case was heavy.

I got a score here all right, he thought. Maybe enough for a
sixteenth and a room . Danny shivered and twitched, feeling a warm
room and heroin emptying into his vein. Let's have a quick look .
He stepped into Morningside Park . No one around.

Jesus, I never see the town this empty .
He opened the suitcase. Two long packages in brown wrapping
paper. He took one out. It felt like meat. He tore the package
open at one end, revealing a woman's naked foot. The toenails
were painted with purple-red polish. He dropped the leg with a
sneer of disgust.
"Holy Jesus!" he exclaimed. "The routines people put down
these days. Legs! Well, I got a case anyway. " He dumped the
other leg out. No bloodstains. He snapped the case shut and walked
away.
"Legs !" he muttered.

He found the Buyer sitting at a table in ]arrow's Cafeteria.
"Thought you might be taking the day off," Danny said, putting
the case down.
The Buyer shook his head sadly. "I got nobody. So what's Christ­
mas to me?" His eyes traveled over the case, poking, testing,
looking for flaws. "What was in it?"
"Nothing. "
"What's the matter? I don't pay enough?"
"I tell you there wasn't nothing in it."
"Okay. So somebody travels with an empty suitcase. Okay. " He
held up three fingers.
"For Christ's sake, Gimpy, give me a nickel. "
"You got somebody else. Why don't he give you a nickel?"

I NTERZ O N E

26

"It's like I say, the case was empty. "
Gimpy kicked at the case disparagingly. "It's all nicked up and
kinda dirty-looking. " He sniffed suspiciously. "How come it stink
like that? Mexican leather?"
"So am I in the leather business?"
Gimpy shrugged. "Could be. " He pulled out a roll of bills and
peeled off three ones, dropping them on the table behind the napkin
dispenser. "You want?"
"Okay . " Danny picked up the money. "You see George the
Greek?" he asked.
"Where you been? He got busted two days ago. "
"Oh . . . That's bad . "
Danny walked out. Now where can I score? h e thought. George
the Greek had lasted so long, Danny thought of him as permanent.

It was good H too, and no short counts .
Danny went up to 103rd and Broadway. Nobody in ]arrow's.
Nobody in the Automat.
"Yeah ," he snarled. "All the pushers off on the nod someplace.
What they care about anybody else? So long as they get it in the
vein. What they care about a sick junky?"
He wiped his nose with one finger, looking around furtively.

No use hitting those jigs in Harlem . Like as not get beat for my
money or they slip me rat poison . Might find Pantopon Rose at
Eighth and 23rd.
There was no one he knew in the 23rd Street Thompson's.
Jesus, he thought. Where is everybody?
He clutched his coat collar together with one hand, looking up
and down the street. There's Joeyfrom Brooklyn . I'd know that hat
anywhere .
"Joey. Hey, Joey!"
Joey was walking away, with his back to Danny. He turned
around. His face was sunken, skull-like. The gray eyes glittered

28

Wlllhun S. Burrough•

under a greasy gray felt hat. Joey was sniffing at regular intervals
and his eyes were watering.

No use asking him, Danny thought. They looked at each other
with the hatred of disappointment.
"Guess you heard about George the Greek," Danny said.
"Yeah. I heard. You been up to l03rd?"
"Yeah. Just came from there. Nobody around. "
"Nobody around anyplace, " Joey said. " I can't even score for
goofballs. "
"Well, Merry Christmas, Joey. See you . "
"Yeah. See you . "

Danny was walking fast. H e had remembered a croaker o n 18th
Street. Of course the croaker had told him not to come back. Still,
it was worth trying.
A brownstone house with a card in the window: P . H. Zunniga,

M D . Danny rang the bell. He heard slow steps. The door opened,
and the doctor looked at Danny with bloodshot brown eyes. He
was weaving slightly and supported his plump body against the
doorjamb. His face was smooth, Latin, the little red mouth slack.
He said nothing. He just leaned there, looking at Danny.

Goddamned alcoholic, Danny thought. He smiled.
"Merry Christmas, Doctor. "
The doctor did not reply.
"You remember me, Doctor. " Danny tried to edge past the
doctor, into the house. "I'm sorry to trouble you on Christmas Day,
but I've suffered another attack. "
"Attack?"
"Yes. Facial neuralgia." Danny twisted one side of his face into
a horrible grimace. The doctor recoiled slightly, and Danny pushed
into the dark hallway.

"Better shut the door or you'll be catching cold," he said jovially,
shoving the door shut.
The doctor looked at him, his eyes focusing visibly. "I can't
give you a prescription, " he said.
"But Doctor, this is a legitimate condition. An emergency, you
understand. "
' "No prescription. Impossible. It's against the law. "
"You took an oath, Doctor. I'm in agony. " Danny's voice shot
up to a hysterical grating whine.
The doctor winced and passed a hand over his forehead.
"Let me think. I can give you one quarter-grain tablet. That's
all I have in the house . "
"But, Doctor-a quarter G .

"

The doctor stopped him. "If your condition is legitimate, you
will not need more. If it isn't, I don't want anything to do with
you. Wait right here. "
The doctor weaved down the hall, leaving a wake of alcoholic
breath. He came back and dropped a tablet into Danny's hand.
Danny wrapped the tablet in a piece of paper and tucked it away.
"There is no charge. " The doctor put his hand on the doorknob.
"And now, my dear . . . "
"But, Doctor-can't you inject the medication?"
"No. You will obtain longer relief in using orally. Please not to
return." The doctor opened the door.

Well, this will take the edge off, and I still have money to put
down on a room, Danny thought.
He knew a drugstore that sold needles without question. He
bought a 26-gauge insulin needle and an eyedropper, which he
selected carefully, rejecting models with a curved dropper or a
thick end. Finally he bought a baby pacifier, to use instead of the
bulb. He stopped in the Automat and stole a teaspoon.
Danny put down two dollars on a six-dollar-a-week room in the
West Forties, where he knew the landlord. He bolted the door and

28

William S. Burrough•

put his spoon , needle and dropper on a table by the bed. He
dropped the tablet in the spoon and covered it with a dropperful
of water. He held a match under the spoon until the tablet dis­
solved. He tore a strip of paper, wet it and wrapped it around the
end of the dropper, fitting the needle over the wet paper to make
an airtight connection. He dropped a piece of lint from his pocket
into the spoon and sucked the liquid into the dropper through the
needle, holding the needle in the lint to take up the last drop.
Danny's hands trembled with excitement and his breath was
quick . With a shot in front of him, his defenses gave way, and
junk sickness flooded his body. His legs began to twitch and ache.
A cramp stirred in his stomach. Tears ran down his face from his
smarting, burning eyes. He wrapped a handkerchief around his
right arm, holding the end in his teeth. He tucked the handkerchief
in, and began rubbing his arm to bring out a vein.

Guess I can hit that one, he thought, running one finger along
a vein. He picked up the dropper in his left hand.
Danny heard a groan from the next room. He frowned with
annoyance. Another groan. He could not help listening. He walked
across the room, the dropper in his hand, and inclined his ear to
the wall. The groans were coming at regular intervals, a horrible
inhuman sound pushed out from the stomach.
Danny listened for a full minute. He returned to the bed and
sat down. Why don't someone call a doctor? he thought indignantly.

It's a bringdown . He straightened his arm and poised the needle.
He tilted his head, listening again.

Oh, for Christ's sake! He tore off the handkerchief and placed
the dropper in a water glass, which he hid behind the wastebasket.
He stepped into the hall and knocked on the door of the next room.
There was no answer. The groans continued. Danny tried the door.
It was open.
The shade was up and the room was full of light. He had expected
an old person somehow, but the man on the bed was very young,

INTERZO N E

28

eighteen or twenty, fully clothed and doubled up, with his hands
clasped across his stomach.
"What's wrong, kid?" Danny asked.
The boy looked at him, his eyes blank with pain. Finally he got
out one word: "Kidneys."
"Kidney stones?" Danny smiled. "I don't mean it's funny, kid.
It\ just . . . I've faked it so many times. Never saw the real thing
before. I'll call an ambulance. "
The boy bit his lip. "Won't come. Doctors won't come. " The
boy hid his face in the pillow.
Danny nodded. "They figure it's just another junky throwing a
wingding for a shot. But your case is legit. Maybe if I went to the
hospital and explained things . . . No, I guess that wouldn't be so
good. "
"Don't live here," the boy said, his voice muffied. "They say
I'm not entitled."
"Yeah, I know how they are, the bureaucrat bastards. I had a
friend once, died of snakebite right in the waiting room. They
wouldn't even listen when he tried to explain a snake bit him. He
never had enough moxie. That was fifteen years ago, down in
Jacksonville . . . . "
Danny trailed off. Suddenly he put out his thin, dirty hand and
touched the boy's shoulder.
"I-I'm sorry, kid. You wait. I'll fix you up."
He went back to his room and got the dropper, and returned to
the boy's room.
"Roll up your sleeve, kid. " The boy fumbled his coat sleeve
with a weak hand.
"That's okay. I'll get it." Danny undid the shirt button at the
wrist and pushed the shirt and coat up, baring a thin brown forearm.
Danny hesitated, looking at the dropper. Sweat ran down his nose.
The boy was looking up at him. Danny shoved the needle in the

30

William S.

Burrough•

boy's forearm and watched the liquid drain i nto the flesh. He
straightened up.
The boy's face began to relax. He sat up and smiled.
"Say, that stuff really works, " he said. "You a doctor, mister?"
"No, kid . "
The boy lay down, stretching. " I feel real sleepy. Didn't sleep
all last night. " His eyes were closing.
Danny walked across the room and pulled the shade down. He
went back to his room and closed the door without locking it. He
sat on the bed, looking at the empty dropper. It was getting dark
outside. Danny's body ached for junk, but it was a dull ache now,
dull and hopeless. Numbly, he took the needle off the dropper
and wrapped it in a piece of paper. Then he wrapped the needle
and dropper together. He sat there with the package in his hand.

Cotta stash this someplace, he thought.
Suddenly a wann flood pulsed through his veins and broke in
his head like a thousand golden speedballs.

For Christ's sake, Danny thought. I must have scored for the
immaculate fix!
The vegetable serenity of junk settled in his tissues. His face
went slack and peaceful, and his head fell forward.
Danny the Car Wiper was on the nod.

LEE AND THE BOYS
The sun spotlights the inner thigh of a boy sitting in shorts on a
doorstep, his legs swinging open, and you fall in spasms-sperm
spurting in orgasm after orgasm, grinding against the stone street,
neck and back break . . . now lying dead, eyes rolled back, showing
slits of white that redden slowly, as blood tears form and run down
the faceOr the sudden clean smell of salt air, piano down a city street,
a dusty poplar tree shaking in the hot afternoon wind, pictures
explode in the brain like skyrockets, smells, tastes, sounds shake
the body, nostalgia becomes unendurable, aching pain, the brain

32

is an overloaded switchboard sending insane messages and coun­
termessages to the viscera. Finally the body gives up, cowering
like a neurotic cat, blood pressure drops, body fluids leak through
stretched, flaccid veins, shock passes to coma and death.
Somebody rapped on the outside shutter. Lee opened the shutter
and looked out. An Arab boy of fourteen or so-they always look
younger than they are-was standing there, smiling in a way that
could only mean one thing. He said something in Spanish that Lee
did not catch. Lee shook his head and started to close the shutter.
The boy, still smiling, held the shutter open. Lee gave a jerk and
slammed the shutter closed. He could feel the rough wood catch
and tear the boy's hand. The boy turned without a word and walked
away, his shoulders drooping, holding his hand. At the corner the
small figure caught a patch of light.

I didn't mean to hurt him, Lee thought. He wished he had given
the boy some money, a smile at least. He felt crude and detestable.
Years ago he had been riding in a hotel station wagon in the
West Indies. The station wagon slowed down for a series of bumps,
and a little black girl ran up smiling and threw a bouquet of flowers
into the car through the rear window. A round-faced, heavyset
American in a brown gabardine suit gathered up the flowers and
said, "No want, " and tossed them at the little girl. The flowers fell
in the dusty road, and the little girl turned around crying and ran
away.
Lee closed the shutter slowly.
In the Rio Grande valley of South Texas, he had killed a rat­
tlesnake with a golf club. The impact of metal on the live flesh of
the snake sent an electric shiver through him.
In New York, when he was rolling lushes on the subway with
Roy, at the end of the line in Brooklyn a drunk grabbed Roy and
started yelling for the law. Lee hit the drunk in the face and
knocked him to his knees, then kicked him in the side. A rib
snapped. Lee felt a shudder of nausea.

I NTERZ O N E

33

Next day he told Roy he was through as a lush worker. Roy
looked at him with his impersonal brown eyes that caught points
of light, like an opal. There was a masculine gentleness in Roy's
voice, a gentleness that only the strong have: "You feel bad about
kicking that mooch, don't you? You're not cut out for this sort of
thing, Bill. I'll find someone else to work with." Roy put on his
hat and started to leave. He stopped with the doorknob in his hand
and turned around.
"It's none of my business, Bill. But you have enough money to
get by. Why don't you just quit?" He walked out without waiting
for Lee to answer.
Lee did not feel like finishing the letter. He put on his coat and
stepped out into the narrow, sunless street.
The druggist saw Lee standing in the doorway of the store. The
store was about eight feet wide, with bottles and packages packed
around three walls. The druggist smiled and held up a finger.
"One?" he said in English.
Lee nodded, looking around at the bottles and packages. The
clerk handed the box of ampules to Lee without wrapping it. Lee
said, "Thank you."
He walked away through a street lined on both sides with ba­
zaars. Merchandise overflowed into the street, and he dodged
crockery and washtubs and trays of combs and pencils and soap
dishes. A train of burros loaded with charcoal blocked his way.
He passed a woman with no nose, a black slit in her face, her
body wrapped in grimy, padded pink cotton. Lee walked fast,
twisting his body sideways, squeezing past people. He reached the
sunny alleys of the outer Medina.
Walking in Tangier was like falling, plunging down dark shafts
of streets, catching at comers, doorways. He passed a blind man
sitting in the sun in a doorway. The man was young, with a fringe
of blond beard. He sat there with one hand out, his shirt open,

34

W i l l iam S.

Bu rrough•

showing the smooth, patient flesh, the slight, immobile folds in
the stomach. He sat there all day, every day.
Lee turned into his street, and a cool wind from the sea chilled
the sweat on his thin body. He hooked the key into the lock and
pushed the door open with his shoulder.
He tied up for the shot, and slid the needle in through a festered
scab. Blood swirled up into the hypo--he was using a regular hypo
these days. He pressed the plunger down with his forefinger. A
passing caress of pleasure flushed through his veins. He glanced
at the cheap alarm clock on the table by the bed: four o'clock. He
was meeting his boy at eight. Time enough for the Eukodal to get
out of his system.
Lee walked about the room. "I have to quit," he said over and
over, feeling the gravity pull of junk in his cells. He experienced
a moment of panic. A cry of despair wrenched his body: "I have
to get out of here. I have to make a break. "
A s h e said the words, h e remembered whose words they were:
the Mad Dog Esposito Brothers, arrested at the scene of a multiple­
slaying holdup , separated from the electric chair by a little time
and a few formalities, whispered these words into a police micro­
phone planted by their beds in the detention ward.
He sat down at the typewriter, yawned, and made some notes
on a separate piece of paper. Lee often spent hours on a letter.
He dropped the pencil and stared at the wall, his face blank and
dreamy, reflecting on the heartwarming picture of William LeeHe was sure the reviewers in those queer magazines like One
would greet Willy Lee as heartwarming, except when he gets­
squirming uneasily-well, you know, a bit out of line, somehow.
"Oh, that's just boyishness-after all, you know a boy's will is
the wind's will, and the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts. "
"Yes I know, but . . . the purple-assed baboons .

"

"That's gangrened innocence. "

I NTERZO N E

36

"Why didn't I think of that myself. And the piles?"
"All kids are like hung up on something. "
"So they are . . . and the prolapsed assholes feeling around,
looking for a peter, like blind worms?"
"Schoolboy smut . "
"Understand, I'm not trying to belittle Lee--"
' "You'd better not. He's a one-hundred-percent wistful boy, lis­
tening to train whistles across the winter stubble and frozen red
clay of Georgia."
-yes, there was something a trifle disquieting in the fact that
the heartwarming picture of William Lee should be drawn by Wil­
liam Lee himself. He thought of the ultimate development in
stooges, a telepathic stooge who tunes in on your psyche and says
just what you want to hear: "Boss, you is heartwarming. You is a
latter-assed purple-day saint. "
Lee put down the pencil and yawned. He looked a t the bed.

I'm sleepy, he decided. He took off his pants and shoes and lay
down on the bed, covering himself with a cotton blanket. They
don't scratch . He closed his eyes. Pictures streamed by, the magic
lantern of junk. There is a feeling of too much junk that corresponds
to the bed spinning around when you are very drunk, a feeling of
gray, dead horror. The pictures in the brain are out of control,
black and white, without emotion, the deadness of junk lying in
the body like a viscous, thick medium.
A child came up to Lee and held up to him a bleeding hand.
"Who did this?" Lee asked. "I'll kill him. Who did it?"
The child beckoned Lee into a dark room. He pointed at Lee
with the bleeding stub of a finger. Lee woke up crying "No! No!"
Lee looked at the clock. It was almost eight. His boy was due
anytime. Lee rummaged in a drawer of the bed table and found a
stick of tea. He lit it and lay back to wait for KiKi. There was
a bitter, green taste in his mouth from the weed. He could feel a

36

William S.

Burrough•

warm tingle spread over his body. He put his hands behind his
head, stretching his ribs and arching his stomach.
Lee was forty, but he had the lean body of an adolescent. He
looked down at the stomach, which curved in flat from the chest.
Junk had sculpted his body down to bone and muscle. He could
feel the wall of his stomach right under the skin. H is skin smooth
and white, he looked almost transparent, like a tropical fish, with
blue veins where the hipbones protruded.
KiKi stepped in. He switched on the light.
"Sleeping?" he asked.
"No, just resting. " Lee got up and put his arms around KiKi,
holding him in a long, tight embrace.
"What's the matter, Meester William?" KiKi said, laughing.
"Nothing. "
They sat down o n the edge of the bed. KiKi ran his hands
absently over Lee's back . He turned and looked at Lee.
"Very thin, " he said. "You should eat more . "
Lee pulled in his stomach s o it almost touched the backbone.
KiKi laughed and ran his hands down Lee's ribs to the stomach.
He put his thumbs on Lee's backbone and tried to encircle Lee's
stomach with his hands. He got up and took off his clothes and
sat down beside Lee, caressing him with casual affection.
Like many Spanish boys, KiKi did not feel love for women. To
him a woman was only for sex. He had known Lee for some months ,
and felt a genuine fondness for him, in an offhand way. Lee was
considerate and generous and did not ask KiKi to do things he
didn't want to do, leaving the lovemaking on an adolescent basis.
KiKi was well pleased with the arrangement.
And Lee was well pleased with KiKi. He did not like the process
of looking for boys. He did not lose interest in a boy after a few
contacts, not being subject to compulsive promiscuity. In Mexico
he had slept with the same boy twice a week for over a year. The

INTERZON E

37

boy had looked enough like KiKi to be his brother. Both had very
straight black hair, an Oriental look, and lean, slight bodies. Both
exuded the same quality of sweet masculine innocence. Lee met
the same people wherever he went.

IN THE CA FE CENTRA L
Johnny the Guide was sitting in front of the Cafe Central with Mrs.
Merrims and her sixteen-year-old son. Mrs. Merrims was traveling
on her husband's insurance. She was well-groomed and competent.
She was making out a list of purchases and places to go. Johnny
leaned forward, solicitous and deferential.
The other guides cruised by like frustrated sharks. Johnny sa­
vored their envy. His eyes slid sideways over the lean adolescent
body of the boy, poised in gray flannels and a sport shirt open at
the neck. Johnny licked his lips.
Hans sat several tables away. He was a German who procured

38

boys for English and American visitors. He had a house in the
native quarter-bed and boy, two dollars per night. But most of
his clients went in for "quickies . " Hans had typical Nordic fea­
tures, with heavy bone structure. There was something skull-like
in his face.
Morton Christie was sitting with Hans. Morton was a pathetic
name-dropper and table-hopper. Hans was the only one in Tangier
who could stand his silly chatter, his interminable dull lies about
wealth and social prominence. One story involved two aunts, living
in a house together, who hadn't spoken to each other in twenty
years.
"But you see, the house is so huge that it doesn't matter, really.
They each have their own set of servants and maintain completely
separate households. "
Hans just sat there and smiled through all of these stories. "It
is a little girl," he would say in defense of Morton. "You must not
be hard with him . "
Actually Morton had, through years o f insecurity-sitting at
tables where he wasn't wanted, desperately attempting to gain a
moment's reprieve from dismissal-gained an acute sense for gos­
sip and scandal. If someone was down with the clap, Morton always
found out somehow. He had a sense for anything anyone was trying
to conceal. The most perfect poker face was no protection against
this telepathic penetration.
Besides, without being a good listener, sympathetic, or in any
way someone you would want to confide in, he had a way of
surprising confidences out of you. Sometimes you forgot he was
there and said something to someone else at the table. Sometimes
he would slip in a question, personal, impertinent, but you an­
swered him before you knew it. His personality was so negative
there was nothing to put you on guard. Hans found Morton's talent
for collecting information useful. He could find out what was hap-

40

William S. Burrougha

pening in town by spending half an hour listening to Morton in the
Cafe Central.
Morton had literally no self-respect, so that his self-esteem went
up or down in accordance with how others felt about him. At first
he often made a good impression. He appeared na"ive, boyish,
friendly. Imperceptibly the naivete degenerated into silly, me­
chanical chatter, his friendliness into compulsive, clinging hunger,
and his boyishness faded before your eyes across a cafe table. You
looked up and saw the deep lines about the mouth, a hard, stupid
mouth like an old whore's, you saw the deep creases in the back
of the neck when he craned around to look at somebody-he was
always looking around restlessly, as if he were waiting for someone
more important than whomever he was sitting with.
There were, to be sure, people who engaged his whole attention.
He twisted in hideous convulsions of ingratiation, desperate as he
saw every pitiful attempt fail flatly, often shitting in his pants with
fear and excitement. Lee wondered if he went home and sobbed
with despair.
Morton's attempts to please socially prominent residents and
visiting celebrities, ending usually in flat failure, or a snub in the
Cafe Central, attracted a special sort of scavenger who feeds on
the humiliation and disintegration of others. These decayed queens
never tired of retailing the endless saga of Morton's social failures.
"So he sat right down with Tennessee Williams on the beach,
and Tennessee said to him: 'I'm not feeling well this morning,

Michael . I'd rather not talk to anybody. ' 'Michael!' Doesn't even
know his name! And he says, 'Oh yes, Tennessee is a good friend
of mine!' " And they would laugh, and throw themselves around
and flip their wrists, their eyes glowing with loathsome lust.

I imagine that's the way people look when they watch someone
burned at the stake, Lee thought.
At another table was a beautiful woman, of mixed Negro and

INTERZON E

41

Malay stock. She was delicately proportioned, with a dark, copper­
colored complexion and small teeth set far apart, her nipples
pointed a little upward. She was dressed in a yellow silk gown and
carried herself with superb grace. At the same table sat a German
woman with perfect features: golden hair curled in braids forming
a tiara, a magnificent bust, and heroic proportions.
'�he was talking to the half-caste. When she opened her mouth
to speak, she revealed horrible teeth, gray, carious, repaired rather
than filled with pieces of steel-some actually rusty, others of
copper covered with green verdigris. The teeth were abnormally
large and crowded over each other. Broken, corroded braces stuck
to them, like an old barbed-wire fence.
Ordinarily she attempted to keep her teeth covered as far as
possible. However, her beautiful mouth was hardly adequate to
perform this function, and the teeth peeked out here and there as
she talked or ate. She never laughed if she could help it, but was
subject to occasional laughing jags brought on by apparently ran­
dom circumstances. The laughing jags were always followed by
fits of crying, during which she would repeat over and over, "Every­
body saw my teeth ! My horrible teeth !"
She was constantly saving up money to have the teeth out, but
somehow she always spent the money on something else. Either
she got drunk on it, or she gave it to someone in an irrational fit
of generosity. She was a mark for every con artist in Tangier,
because she was known to have the money she was always saving
up to have her teeth out. But putting the touch on her was not
without danger. She would suddenly turn vicious and maul some
mooch with all the strength of her Junoesque limbs, shouting, "You
lousy bastard ! Trying to con me out of my teeth money!"
Both the half-caste and the Nordic, who had taken on herself
the name of Helga, were free-lance whores.

DREAM O F THE
PENAL CO LONY
That night Lee dreamed he was in a penal colony. All around were
high, bare mountains. He lived in a boardinghouse that was never
warm. He went out for a walk. As he stepped off the street comer
onto a dirty cobblestone street, the cold mountain wind hit him.
He tightened the belt of a leather jacket and felt the chill of final
despair.
Nobody talks much after the first few years in the colony, because
they know the others are in identical conditions of misery. They
sit at table, eating the cold, greasy food, separate and silent as

stones. Only the whiny, penetrating voice of the landlady goes on
and on.
The colonists mix with the townspeople, and it is difficult to
pick them out. But sooner or later they betray themselves by a
misplaced intensity, which derives from the exclusive preoccu­
pation with escape. There is also the penal-colony look: control,
without inner calm or balance; bitter knowledge, without maturity;
intensity, without warmth or love.
The colonists know that any spontaneous expression of feeling
brings the harshest punishment. Provocative agents continually
mix with the prisoners, saying, "Relax. Be yourself. Express your
real feelings. " Lee was convinced that the means to escape lay
through a relationship with one of the townspeople, and to that
end he frequented the cafes.
One day he was sitting in the Metropole opposite a young man.
The young man was talking about his childhood in a coastal town.
Lee sat staring through the boy's head, seeing the salt marshes,
the red-brick houses, the old rusty barge by the inlet where the
boys took off their clothes to swim.

This may be it, Lee thought. Easy now . Cool, cool. Don't scare
him off. Lee's stomach knotted with excitement.
During the following week, Lee tried every approach he knew,
shamelessly throwing aside unsuccessful routines with a shrug: "I
was only kidding," or, "Son cosas de la vida ." He descended to
the most abject emotional blackmail and panhandling. When this
failed, he scaled a dangerous cliff (not quite so dangerous either,
since he knew every inch of the ascent) to capture a species of
beautiful green lizard found only on these ledges. He gave the boy
the lizard, attached to a chain of jade.
"It took me seven years to carve that chain," Lee said. Actually
he had won the chain from a traveling salesman in a game of Latah.
The boy was touched, and consented to go to bed with Lee, but
soon afterward broke off intimate relationships. Lee was in despair.

/ love him and besides, I haven't discovered the Secret . Perhaps
he is an Agent . Lee looked at the boy with hatred. His face was
breaking up, as if melted from inside by a blowtorch.
"Why won't you help me?" he demanded. "Do you want another
lizard? I will get you a black lizard with beautiful violet eyes, that
lives on the west slope where the winds pick climbers from the
cliff and suck them out of crevices. There is only one other purple­
eyed lizard in town and that one-well, never mind. The purple­
eyed lizard is more venomous than a cobra, but he never bites his
master. He is the sweetest and gentlest animal on earth. Just let
me show you how sweet and gentle a purple-eyed lizard can be. "
"Never mind , " said the boy, laughing. "Anyhoo, one lizard is
enough . "
"Don't say anyhoo. Well, I will cut off m y foot and shrink i t
down b y a process I learned from the Auca, and make you a watch
fob. "
"What I want with your ugly old foot?"
"I will get you money for a guide and a pack train. You can
return to the coast. "
"I'll go back there anytime I feel like it. My brother-in-law knows
the route. "
The thought of someone being able to leave at will so enraged
Lee that he was in danger of losing control. His sweaty hand gripped
the snap-knife in his pocket.
The boy looked at him with distaste. "You look very nasty. Your
face has turned all sorta black, greenish-black. Are you deliber­
ately trying to make me sick?"
Lee turned on all the control that years of confinement had taught
him. His face faded from greenish-black to mahogany, and back
to its normal suntanned brown color. The control was spreading
through his body like a shot of M. Lee smiled smoothly, but a
muscle in his cheek twitched.
"Just an old Shipibo trick. They tum themselves black for night

hunting, you understand. . . . Did I ever tell you about the time

I ran out of K-Y in the headwaters of the Effendi? That was the
year of the rindpest, when everything died, even the hyenas . "
Lee went into one of his routines. The boy was laughing now.
Lee made a dinner appointment.
"All right," said the boy. "But no more of your Shipibo tricks. "
Lee laughed with easy joviality. "Gave you a turn, eh, young
man? Did me too, the first time I saw it. Puked up a tapeworm.
Well, good night. "

INTERNATIONA L ZONE
A miasma of suspicion and snobbery hangs over the European
Quarter of Tangier. Everyone looks you over for the price tag,
appraising you like merchandise in terms of immediate practical
or prestige advantage. The Boulevard Pasteur is the Fifth Avenue
of Tangier. The store clerks tend to be discourteous unless you
buy something immediately. Inquiries without purchase are coldly
and grudgingly answered.
My first night in town I went to a fashionable bar, one of the
few places that continues prosperous in the present slump: dim

47

light, well-dressed androgynous clientele, reminiscent of many
bars on New York's Upper East Side.
I started conversation with a man on my right. He was wearing
one of those brown sackcloth jackets, the inexpensive creation of
an ultra-chic Worth Avenue shop. Evidently it is the final touch
of smartness to appear in a twelve-dollar jacket, the costume jew­
elry pattern-I happened to know just where the jacket came from
and how much it cost because I had one like it in my suitcase. (A
few days later I gave it to a shoeshine boy. )
The man's face was gray, puffy, set i n a mold of sour discontent,

rich discontent. It's an expression you see more often on women,
and if a woman sits there long enough with that expression of rich
discontent and sourness, a Cadillac simply builds itself around
her. A man would probably accrete a Jaguar. Come to think, I
had seen a Jaguar parked outside the bar.
The man answered my questions in cautious, short sentences,
carefully deleting any tinge of warmth or friendliness.
"Did you come here direct from the States?" I persisted.
"No. From Brazil."
He's warming up, I thought. I expected it would take two sentences to elicit that much information.
"So? And how did you come?''
"By yacht, of course ."
I felt that anything would be an anticlimax after that, and allowed
my shaky option on his notice to lapse.
The European Quarter of Tangier contains a surprising number
of first-class French and international restaurants, where excellent
food is served at very reasonable prices. Sample menu at The
Alhambra, one of the best French restaurants: Snails a la bour­
gogne, one half partridge with peas and potatoes, a frozen chocolate
mousse, a selection of French cheeses, and fruit. Price: one dollar.
This price and menu can be duplicated in ten or twelve other
restaurants.

48

William S. Burrougha

Walking downhill from the European Quarter, we come, by
inexorable process of suction, to the Socco Chico-Little Market­
which is no longer a market at all but simply a paved rectangle
about a block long, lined on both sides with shops and cafes. The
Cafe Central, by reason of a location that allows the best view of
the most people passing through the Socco, is the official meeting
place of the Socco Chico set. Cars are barred from the Socco
between 8 A . M. and 12 midnight. Often groups without money to
order coffee will stand for hours in the Socco, talking. During the
day they can sit in front of the cafes without ordering, but from 5
to 8 P. M . they must relinquish their seats to paying clients, unless
they can strike up a conversation with a group of payers.
The Socco Chico is the meeting place, the nerve center, the
switchboard of Tangier. Practically everyone in town shows there
once a day at least. Many residents of Tangier spend most of their
waking hours in the Socco. On all sides you see men washed up
here in hopeless, dead-end situations, waiting for job offers, ac­
ceptance checks, visas, permits that will never come. All their
lives they have drifted with an unlucky current, always taking the
wrong turn. Here they are. This is it. Last stop: the Socco Chico
of Tangier.
The market of psychic exchange is as glutted as the shops. A
nightmare feeling of stasis permeates the Socco, like nothing can
happen, nothing can change. Conversations disintegrate in cosmic
inanity. People sit at cafe tables, silent and separate as stones.
No other relation than physical closeness is possible. Economic
laws, untouched by any human factor, evolve equations of ultimate
stasis. Someday the young Spaniards in gabardine trench coats
talking about soccer, the Arab guides and hustlers pitching pennies
and smoking their keif pipes, the perverts sitting in front of the
cafes looking over the boys, the boys parading past, the mooches
and pimps and smugglers and money changers, will be frozen
forever in a final, meaningless posture.

I NTERZO N E

49

Futility seems to have gained a new dimension in the Socco.
Sitting at a cafe table, listening to some "proposition, " I would
suddenly realize that the other was telling a fairy story to a child,
the child inside himself: pathetic fantasies of smuggling, of traf­
ficking in diamonds, drugs, guns, of starting nightclubs, bowling
alleys, travel agencies. Or sometimes there was nothing wrong with
the idea, except it would never be put into practice-the crisp,
confident voice, the decisive gestures, in shocking contrast to the
dead, hopeless eyes, drooping shoulders, clothes beyond mending,
now allowed to disintegrate undisturbed.
Some of these men have ability and intelligence, like Brinton,
who writes unpublishably obscene novels and exists on a small
income. He undoubtedly has talent, but his work is hopelessly
unsalable. He has intelligence, the rare ability to see relations
between disparate factors, to coordinate data, but he moves through
life like a phantom, never able to find the time, place and person
to put anything into effect, to realize any project in terms of three­
dimensional reality. He could have been a successful business
executive, anthropologist, explorer, criminal, but the conjuncture
of circumstances was never there. He is always too late or too
early. His abilities remain larval, discarnate. He is the last of an
archaic line, or the first here from another space-time way-in any
case a man without context, of no place and no time.
Chris, the English Public School man, is the type who gets
involved in fur farming, projects to raise ramie, frogs, cultured
pearls. He had, in fact, lost all his savings in a bee-raising venture
in the West Indies. He had observed that all the honey was imported
and expensive. It looked like a sure thing, and he invested all he
had. He did not know about a certain moth preying on the bees
in that area, so that bee-raising is impossible.
"The sort of thing that could only happen to Chris," his friends
say, for this is one chapter in a fantastic saga of misfortune. Who
but Chris would be caught short at the beginning of the war, in a

150

total shortage of drugs, and have a molar extracted without an­
esthetic? On another occasion he had collapsed with peritonitis
and been shanghaied into a Syrian hospital, where they never heard
of penicillin. He was rescued, on the verge of death, by the English
consul. During the Spanish occupation of Tangier, he had been
mistaken for a Spanish Communist and held for three weeks in­
communicado in a detention camp.
Now he is broke and jobless in the Socco Chico, an i ntelligent
man , willing to work, speaking several languages fluently, yet
bearing the i ndelible brand of bad luck and failure. He is carefully
shunned by the Jaguar-driving set, who fear contagion from the
mysterious frequency that makes, of men like Chris, lifelong fail­
ures. He manages to stay alive teaching English and selling whis­
key on commission.
Robbins is about fifty, with the face of a Cockney informer, the
archetypal "Copper's Nark. " He has a knack of pitching his whiny
voice directly into your consciousness. No external noise drowns
him out. Robbins looks like some unsuccessful species of Homo

non sapien.s, blackmailing the human race with his existence.
"Remember me? I'm the boy you left back there with the lemurs
and the baboons. I'm not equipped for survival like some people. "
He holds out his deformed hands, hideously infantile, unfinished,
his greedy blue eyes searching for a spot of guilt or uncertainty,
on which he will fasten like a lamprey.
Robbins had all his money in his wife's name to evade income
tax, and his wife ran away with a perfidious Australian. ("And I
thought he was my friend . ") This is one story. Robbins has a series,
all involving his fall from wealth, betrayed and cheated by dis­
honest associates. He fixes his eyes on you probingly, accusingly:
are you another betrayer who would refuse a man a few pesetas
when he is down?
Robbins also comes on with the "I can't go home" routine,
hinting at dark crimes committed in his native land. �1any of the

I NTERZO N E

&1

Socco Chico regulars say they can't go home, trying to mitigate
the dead gray of prosaic failure with a touch of borrowed color.
As a matter of fact, if anyone was wanted for a serious crime,
the authorities could get him out of Tangier in ten minutes. As for
these stories of disappearing into the Native Quarter, living there
only makes a foreigner that much more conspicuous. Any guide
or shoeshine boy would lead the cops to your door for five pesetas
or a few cigarettes. So when someone gets confidential over the
third drink you have bought him and tells you he can't go home,
you are hearing the classic prelude to a touch.
A Danish boy is stranded here waiting for a friend to come with
money and "the rest of his luggage. " Every day he meets the ferry
from Gibraltar and the ferry from Algeciras. A Spanish boy is
waiting for a permit to enter the French Zone (for some reason
persistently denied) , where his uncle will give him a job. An
English boy was robbed of all his money and valuables by a
girlfriend.
I have never seen so many people in one place without money,
or any prospects of money. This is partly due to the fact that anyone
can enter Tangier. You don't have to prove solvency. So people
come here hoping to get a job, or become smugglers. But there
are no jobs in Tangier, and smuggling is as overcrowded as any
other line. So they end up on the bum in the Socco Chico.
All of them curse Tangier, and hope for some miracle that will
deliver them from the Socco Chico. They will get a job on a yacht,
they will write a best-seller, they will smuggle a thousand cases
of Scotch into Spain, they will find someone to finance their roulette
system. It is typical of these people that they all believe in some
gambling system, usually a variation on the old routine of doubling
up when you lose, which is the pattern of their lives. They always
back up their mistakes with more of themselves.
Some of the Socco Chico regulars, like Chris, make a real effort
to support themselves. Others are full-time professional spongers.

Antonio the Portuguese is mooch to the bone. He won't work. In
a sense, he can't work. He is a mutilated fragment of the human
potential, specialized to the point where he cannot exist without a
host. H is mere presence is an irritation. Phantom tendrils reach
out from him, feeling for a point of weakness on which to fasten.
Jimmy the Dane is another full-time mooch. He has a gift for
showing precisely when you don't want to see him, and saying
exactly what you don't want to hear. His technique is to make you
dislike him more than his actual behavior, a bit obnoxious to be
sure, warrants. This makes you feel guilty toward him, so you buy
him off with a drink or a few pesetas.
Some mooches specialize in tourists and transients, making no
attempt to establish themselves on terms of social equality with
the long-term residents. They use some variation of the short con,
strictly one-time touches.
There is a Jewish mooch who looks vaguely like a detective or
some form of authority. He approaches a tourist in a somewhat
peremptory manner. The tourist anticipates an inspection of his
passport or some other annoyance. When he finds out it is merely
a question of a small "loan," he often gives the money in relief.
A young Norwegian has a routine of approaching visitors without
his glass eye, a really unnerving sight. He needs money to buy a
glass eye, or he will lose a job he is going to apply for in the
morning. "How can I work as a waiter looking so as this?" he says,
turning his empty socket on the victim. "I would frighten the
customers, is it not?"
Many of the Socco Chico regulars are left over from the Boom.
A few years ago the town was full of operators and spenders. There
was a boom of money changing and transfer, smuggling and bor­
derline enterprise. Restaurants and hotels turned customers away.
Bars served a full house around the clock.
What happened? What gave out? What corresponds to the gold,
the oil, the construction projects? Largely, inequalities in prices

and exchange rates. Tangier is a clearinghouse, from which cur­
rency and merchandise move in any direction toward higher prices.
Under this constant flow of goods, shortages created by the war
are supplied, prices and currency approach standard rates, and
Tangier is running down like the dying universe, where no move­
ment is possible because all energy is equally distributed.
, Tangier is a vast overstocked market, everything for sale and
no buyers. A glut of obscure brands of Scotch, inferior German
cameras and Swiss watches, second-run factory-reject nylons, type­
writers unknown anywhere else, is displayed in shop after shop.
There is quite simply too much of everything, too much merchan­
dise, housing, labor, too many guides, pimps, prostitutes and
smugglers. A classic, archetypical depression.
The guides of Tangier are in a class by themselves, and I have
never seen their equal for insolence, persistence and all-around
obnoxiousness. It is not surprising that the very word "guide"
carries, in Tangier, the strongest opprobrium.
The Navy issues a bulletin on what to do if you find yourself in
shark-infested waters: "Above all, avoid making uncoordinated,
flailing movements that might be interpreted by a shark as the
struggles of a disabled fish. " The same advice might apply to
keeping off guides. They are infallibly attracted by the uncoor­
dinated movements of the tourist in a strange medium. The least
show of uncertainty, of not knowing exactly where you are going,
and they rush on you from their lurking places in side streets and
Arab cafes.
"Want nice girl, mister?"
"See Kasbah? Sultan's Palace?"
"Want keif? Watch me fuck my sister?"
"Caves of Hercules? Nice boy?"
Their persistence is amazing, their impertinence unlimited.
They will follow one for blocks, finally demanding a tip for the
time they have wasted.

Female prostitution is largely confined to licensed houses. On
the other hand, male prostitutes are everywhere. They assume that
all visitors are homosexual, and solicit openly in the streets. I have
been approached by boys who could not have been over twelve.
A casino would certainly bring in more tourists, and do much
to alleviate the economic condition of Tangier. But despite the
concerted efforts of merchants and hotel owners, all attempts to
build a casino have been blocked by the Spanish on religious
grounds.
Tangier has a dubious climate. The winters are cold and wet.
In summer the temperature is pleasant, neither too hot nor too
cool, but a constant wind creates a sandstorm on the beach, and
people who sit there all day get sand in their ears and hair and
eyes. Owing to a current, the water is shock-cold in mid-August,
so even the hardiest swimmers can only stay in a few minutes.
The beach is not much of an attraction.
All in all , Tangier does not have much to offer the visitor except
low prices and a buyer's market. I have mentioned the unusually
large number of good restaurants (a restaurant guide put out by
the American and Foreign Bank lists eighteen first-class eating
places where the price for a complete meal ranges from eighty
cents to two dollars and a half). You have your choice of apartments
and houses. Sample price for one large room with bath and balcony
overlooking the harbor, comfortably furnished, utilities and maid
service included: $25 per month. And there are comfortable rooms
for $ 10. A tailor-made suit of imported English material that would
cost $ 1 50 in the U . S . is $50 in Tangier. Name brands of Scotch
run $2 to $2. 50 a fifth.
Americans are exempt from the usual annoyances of registering
with the police, renewing visas and so forth, that one encounters
in Europe and South America. No visa is required for Tangier.
You can stay as long as you want, work, if you can find a job, or
go into business, without any formalities or permits. And Ameri-

I NTERZ O N E

15 15

cans have extraterritorial rights in Tangier. Cases civil or criminal
involving an American citizen are tried in consular court, under
District of Columbia law.
The legal system of Tangier is rather complex. Criminal cases
are tried by a mixed tribunal of three judges. Sentences are com­
paratively mild. Two years is usual for burglary, even if the criminal
ha� a long record. A sentence of more than five years is extremely
rare. Tangier does have capital punishment. The method is a firing
squad of ten gendarmes. I know of only one case in recent years
in which a death sentence was carried out.
In the Native Quarter one feels definite currents of hostility,
which, however, are generally confined to muttering in Arabic as
you pass. Occasionally I have been openly insulted by drunken
Arabs, but this is rare. You can walk in the Native Quarter of
Tangier with less danger than on Third Avenue of New York City
on a Saturday night.
Violent crime is rare. I have walked the streets at all hours,
and never was any attempt made to rob me. The infrequency of
armed robbery is due less, I think, to the pacific nature of the
Arabs than to the certainty of detection in a town where everybody
knows everybody else, and where the penalties for violent crime,
especially if committed by a Moslem, are relatively severe.
The Native Quarter of Tangier is all you expect it to be: a maze
of narrow, sunless streets, twisting and meandering like footpaths,
many of them blind alleys. After four months, I still find my way
in the Medina by a system of moving from one landmark to another.
The smell is almost incredible, and it is difficult to identify all the
ingredients. Hashish, seared meat and sewage are well repre­
senteci. You see filth, poverty, disease, all endured with a curiously
apathetic indifference.
People carry huge loads of charcoal down from the mountains
on their backs-that is, the women carry loads of charcoal. The
men ride on donkeys. No mistaking the position of women in this

66

Wllllarn S. Burrougha

society. I noticed a large percentage of these charcoal carriers had
their noses eaten away by disease, but was not able to determine
whether there is any occupational correlation. It seems more likely
that they all come from the same heavily infected district.
Hashish is the drug of Islam, as alcohol is ours, opium the drug
of the Far East, and cocaine that of South America. No effort is
made to control its sale or use in Tangier, and every native cafe
reeks of the smoke. They chop up the leaves on a wooden block,
mix it with tobacco, and smoke it in little clay pipes with a long
wooden stem.
Europeans occasion no surprise or overt resentment in Arab
cafes. The usual drink is mint tea served very hot in a tall glass.
If you hold the glass by top and bottom, avoiding the sides, it
doesn't bum the hand. You can buy hashish, or keif, as they call
it here, in any native cafe. It can also be purchased in sweet,
resinous cakes to eat with hot tea. This resinous substance, a gum
extracted from the cannabis plant, is the real hashish, and much
more powerful than the leaves and flowers of the plant. The gum
is called majoun, and the leaves keif. Good majoun is hard to find
in Tangier.
Keif is identical with our marijuana, and we have here an op­
portunity to observe the effects of constant use on a whole popu­
lation. I asked a European physician if he had noted any definite
ill effects. He said: "In general, no. Occasionally there is drug
psychosis, but it rarely reaches an acute stage where hospitalization
is necessary." I asked if Arabs suffering from this psychosis are
dangerous. He said: "I have never heard of any violence directly
and definitely traceable to keif. To answer your question, they are
usually not dangerous. "
The typical Arab cafe i s one room, a few tables and chairs, a
huge copper or brass samovar for making tea and coffee. A raised
platform covered with mats extends across one end of the room.
Here the patrons loll about with their shoes off, smoking keif and

INTERZO N E

15 7

playing cards. The game is Redondo, played with a pack of forty­
two cards-rather an elementary card game. Fights start, stop,
people walk around, play cards, smoke keif, all in a vast, timeless
dream.
There is usually a radio turned on full volume. Arab music has
neither beginning nor end. It is timeless. Heard for the first time,
it may appear meaningless to a Westerner, because he is listening
for a time structure that isn't there.
I talked with an American psychoanalyst who is practicing in
Casablanca. He says you can never complete - analysis with an
Arab. Their superego structure is basically different. Perhaps you
can't complete analysis with an Arab because he has no sense of
time. He never completes anything. It is interesting that the drug
of Islam is hashish, which affects the sense of time so that events,
instead of appearing in an orderly structure of past, present and
future, take on a simultaneous quality, the past and future con­
tained in the present moment.
Tangier seems to exist on several dimensions. You are always
finding streets, squares, parks you never saw before. Here fact
merges into dream, and dreams erupt into the real world. Unfin­
ished buildings fall into ruin and decay, Arabs move in silently
like weeds and vines. A catatonic youth moves through the mar­
ketplace, bumping into people and stalls like a sleepwalker. A
man, barefooted, in rags, his face eaten and tumescent with a
horrible skin disease, begs with his eyes alone. He does not have
the will left to hold out his hand. An old Arab passionately kisses
the sidewalk. People stop to watch for a few moments with bestial
curiosity, then move on.
Nobody in Tangier is exactly what he seems to be. Along with
the bogus fugitives of the Socco Chico are genuine political exiles
from Europe: Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, Republican
Spaniards, a selection of Vichy French and other collaborators,
fugitive Nazis. The town is full of vaguely disreputable Europeans

158

William S. Burrough•

who do not have adequate documents to go anywhere else. So many
people are here who cannot leave, lacking funds or papers or both.
Tangier is a vast penal colony.
The special attraction of Tangier can be put in one word: ex­
emption. Exemption from i nterference, legal or otherwise. Your
private life is your own, to act exactly as you please. You will be
talked about, of course. Tangier is a gossipy town, and everyone
in the foreign colony knows everyone else. But that is all. No legal
pressure or pressure of public opinion will curtail your behavior.
The cop stands here with his hands behind his back, reduced to
his basic function of keeping order. That is all he does. He is the
other extreme from the thought police of police states, or our own
vice squad.
Tangier is one of the few places left in the world where, so long
as you don't proceed to robbery, violence, or some form of crude,
antisocial behavior, you can do exactly what you want. It is a
sanctuary of noninterference.

LEE'S
JOURNALS

LE E'S JOURNA LS
Lee's face, his whole person, seemed at first glance completely
anonymous. He looked like an FBI man, like anybody. But the
absence of trappings, of anything remotely picturesque or baroque,
distinguished and delineated Lee, so that seen twice you would
not forget him. Sometimes his face looked blurred, then it would
come suddenly into focus, etched sharp and naked by the flashbulb
of urgency. An electric distinction poured out of him, impregnated
his shabby clothes, his steel-rimmed glasses, his dirty gray felt hat.
These objects could be recognized anywhere as belonging to Lee.
His face had the look of a superimposed photo, reflecting a

83

fractured spirit that could never love man or woman with complete
wholeness. Yet he was driven by an intense need to make his love
real, to change fact. Usually he selected someone who could not
reciprocate, so that he was able-cautiously, like one who tests
uncertain ice, though in this case the danger was not that the ice
give way but that it might hold his weight-to shift the burden of
�ot loving, of being unable to love, onto the partner.
The objects of his high-tension love felt compelled to declare
neutrality, feeling themselves surrounded by a struggle of dark
purposes, not in direct danger, only liable to be caught in the line
of fire. Lee never came on with a kill-lover-and-self routine. Bas­
ically the loved one was always and forever an Outsider, a By­
stander, an Audience.

Went to Brion Gysin's place in the Medina for lunch: Brion,
Dave Morton, Leif and Marv, and a handsome New Zealander who
is passing through the Zone. A ghastly, meaningless aggregate.
Morton said to me: "How long were you in medical school before
they found out you weren't a corpse?"
The standard double entendres and coy references to test the
stranger. Brion says: "I'm queer for shoes," and begins polishing
his shoes during lunch.
Marv says: "I'm very sensitive to that word. I wish you wouldn't
use it," rolling his round gray eyes, speckled with flaws and opaque
spots like damaged marbles, at the young stranger . . . . Oh God!
But none of this is the real horror. Looking around the room, I
suddenly saw that the other people were figures in a waking night­
mare where no contact with anyone else is possible.
Somehow it was worse than a gathering of out-and-out squares,
say the St. Louis country club set I was brought up with. There,
a dreary formalism reigns. It is just dull. But this was horrible,
pointing to some final impasse of communication. There was noth-

filled the room with its blighting frequency, a sound like insect
wings rubbing together.
Dream: I am in Interzone some years ago. I meet a silly fairy
who twists every remark into obscene, queer double entendre.
Under this vacuous camping I see pure evil. We meet two lesbians,
and they say, "Hello, boys, " a dead, ritual greeting from which I
turn away in disgust. The fairy follows me, moves into a house
with me. I feel nauseated, as if a loathsome insect had attached
itself to my body.
I am walking out along a dry, white road on the outskirts of
town. There is danger here. A dry, brown, vibrating hum or fre­
quency in the air, like insect wings rubbing together. I pass a
village: mounds about two feet high, of black cloth over wire frames
like a vast hive.
Back in the city. Everywhere is the dry hum. Not a sound,
exactly, but a frequency, a wavelength. A Holy Man with a black
face is causing the waves. He operates from a tower-like structure
covered with cloth.
I contract to assassinate the Holy Man. An Arab gives me a
pink slip to present at a gun store, where a rifle with a telescopic
sight will be issued to me. A Friend walks with me. He says:
"There is no use to oppose the Holy Man. The Holy Man is reality.
The Holy Man is Right. "
"You're wrong, " I say. "Wrong! I don't want to see you again
for all eternity. "
I hide from the Friend in a florist's shop, under a case of flowers.
He stands by the case as though at my coffin, crying and wringing
his hands and begging me to give up the assassination of the Holy
Man. I am crying too, my tears falling in yellow dust, but I won't
gtve up.
It is frequently said that the Great Powers will never give up
the Interzone because of its value as a listening post. It is in fact

I NTERZO N E

8&

the listening post of the world, the slowing pulse of a decayed
civilization, that only war can quicken. Here East meets West in
a final debacle of misunderstanding, each seeking the Answer, the
Secret, from the other and not finding it, because neither has the
Answer to give.

I catch sluggish flies in the air with the curious pleasure one
derives from taking an eyelash from an eye, or extracting a hair
from a nostril, the moment when the hair gives way with a little
snap and you turn the greasy black hair between finger and thumb,
looking at the white root, reluctant to let it go. So I felt the cold
fly moving between my fingers, and the soft crunch as I delicately
crushed the head to avoid a hemorrhage of sticky juice or blood­
Where does the blood come from? Do they bite and suck blood?­
finally letting the dead fly drop to the floor, spinning like a dry
leaf.

Failure is mystery. A man does not mesh somehow with time­
place. He has savvy, the ability to interpret the data collected by
technicians, but he moves through the world like a ghost, never
able to find the time-place and person to put anything into effect,
to give it flesh in a three-dimensional world.
I could have been a successful bank robber, gangster, business
executive, psychoanalyst, drug trafficker, explorer, bullfighter, but
the conjuncture of circumstances was never there. Over the years
I begin to doubt if my time will ever come. It will come, or it will
not come. There is no use trying to force it. Attempts to break
through have led to curbs, near disasters, warnings. I cultivate an
alert passivity, as though watching an opponent for the slightest
sign of weakness.

Of course there is always the possibility of reckless break­
through, carrying a pistol around and shooting anybody who annoys
me, taking narcotic supplies at gunpoint, amok a form of active
suicide. Even that would require some signal from outside, or from
so deep inside that it comes to the same thing. I have always seen
inside versus outside as a false dichotomy. There is no sharp line
of separation. Perhaps:
"Give it to me straight, Doc. "
"Very well . .

.

A year perhaps, following a regime . . . " H e

i s reaching for a pad.
"Never mind the regime. That's all I wanted to know. "
Or simply the explosion of knowing, finally: "This is your last
chance to step free of the cautious, aging, frightened flesh. What
are you waiting for? To die in an old men's home, draping your
fragile buttocks on a bench in the dayroom?"

Just thought of the story about how cats sit on your chest and
breathe your breath out of you so you suffocate. Just sit there, you
dig, their nose one-quarter inch from yours, and whenever you
take a breath you get the eat's exhaust carbon dioxide. This story
is like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Invented by cat-haters.
So I start an anti-cat movement, pointing out their sneaky, sensual,
unmoral traits, and begin wholesale extermination, genocide of the
feline concept. There is always money in hate.
Perhaps Hitler was right in a way. That is, perhaps certain
subspecies of genus Homo sapiens are incompatible. Live and let
live is impossible. If you let live, they will kill you by creating an
environment in which you have no place and will die out. The
present psychic environment is increasingly difficult for me to
endure, but there is still leeway, slack that could be taken up at
any time. Safety lies in exterminating the type that produces the

I NTERZO N E

87

environment m which you cannot live. So I will die soon-why
bother? Some form of transmigration seems to me probable. I am
now, therefore I always was and always will be.

Looking down at my shiny, dirty trousers that haven't been
changed in months, the days gliding by, strung on a syringe with
a long thread of blood . . . it is easy to forget sex and drink and
all the sharp pleasures of the body in this Limbo of negative
pleasure, this thick cocoon of comfort.
More and more trouble at the farmacia . Spent all day until 5
P.M. to score two boxes of Eukodal.

I'm running out of everything

now. Out of veins, out of money. I can sense the static at the
drugstore, the mutterings of control like a telephone off the hook.

"Muy dificil ahora, " the druggist tells me.
What is this creeping cancer of control? The suicided German
is a plant, a pretext- Some days ago I was standing in a bar when
a man touched my arm. I immediately made him for fuzz. In my
pocket I had a box of methadone ampules I had just bought in the
Plaza Farmacia. Could he be concerned about that? No, not in the
Zone. He asked me if I was Max Gustav. I said, "No," naturally.
The cop had a passport and showed me Gustav's picture, which
he thought resembled me.
Next day I read in the paper that Max Gustav had been found
dead in a ditch outside the town, apparently a suicide from overdose
of Nembutal. It seems at the time the cop asked if I was Max they
did not know he was dead. He had checked out of his hotel, leaving
a suitcase. After two days the hotel called the law. They opened
the suitcase, found the passport, and started looking for Max Gus­
tav . . . . Well, the next time I went to the Plaza Farmacia they
would not sell me methadone ampules without a script. A new
regulation had gone into effect as a result of Max Gustav's suicide.

And that shows how things are related, or something. Bill Gains
here would be the last straw. But everything has two faces. You
need a paper now for everything. Why not apply for a permit to
buy junk?

Such a sharp depression. I haven't felt like this since the day
Joan died.
Spent the morning sick, waiting for Eukodal. Kept seeing fa­
miliar faces, people I had seen as store clerks, waiters, et cetera.
In a small town these familiar faces accumulate and back up on
you, so you are choked with familiarity on every side.
Sitting in front of the Interzone Cafe, sick , waiting for Eukodal.
A boy walked by and I turned my head, following his loins the
way a lizard turns its head, following the course of a fly.
Running short of money. Must kick habit.
What am I trying to do in writing? This novel is about transitions,
larval forms, emergent telepathic faculty, attempts to control and
stifle new forms.
I feel there is some hideous new force loose in the world like a
creeping sickness, spreading, blighting. Remoter parts of the world
seem better now, because they are less touched by it. Control,
bureaucracy, regimentation, these are merely symptoms of a deeper
sickness that no political or economic program can touch. What
is the sickness itself?

Dream: Found a man with both hands cut off. I was pounng
water on the stubs to stop the bleeding- Years ago in New York
a young hoodlum borrowed a gun from me and never returned it.
In a spasm of hate, I put a curse on him. A few days later both
his hands were blown off when a gasoline drum exploded while

I NTERZO N E

89

he was working on it. He died. Are curses effective? Of course
they are, to some extent.
More and more physical symptoms of depression. The latest is
a burning sensation in the chest.

, Until the age of thirty-five, when I wrote Junky, I had a special
abhorrence for writing, for my thoughts and feelings put down on
a piece of paper. Occasionally I would write a few sentences and
then stop, overwhelmed with disgust and a sort of horror. At the
present time, writing appears to me as an absolute necessity, and
at the same time I have a feeling that my talent is lost and I can
accomplish nothing, a feeling like the body's knowledge of disease,
which the mind tries to evade and deny.
This feeling of horror is always with me now. I had the same
feeling the day Joan died; and once when I was a child, I looked
out into the hall, and such a feeling of fear and despair came over
me, for no outward reason, that I burst into tears. I was looking
into the future then. I recognize the feeling, and what I saw has
not yet been realized. I can only wait for it to happen. Is it some
ghastly occurrence like Joan's death, or simply deterioration and
failure and final loneliness, a dead-end setup where there is no
one I can contact? I am just a crazy old bore in a bar somewhere
with my routines? I don't know, but I feel trapped and doomed.

Waiting for Eukodal, I was subject to a series of beggars. Two
girls paralyzed from the waist down, swinging around on blocks.
They bar the way, clutching at my pants legs. An English seaman
on the beach. He gets his face very close to mine, and says, "You
may be in the same position someday. " I go into a cafe and sit at
the counter drinking a cup of coffee. A child about seven years

70

William S.

Burrough•

old, barefooted and dirty, touches my arm. These people are raised
in beggary and buggery.
The nightmare feeling of my childhood is more and more my
habitual condition. Is this a prevision of atomic debacle? Dream
of a sixteenth-century Norwegian: He saw a black, mushroom­
shaped cloud darkening the earth.
We have a new type of rule now. Not one-man rule, or rule of
aristocracy or plutocracy, but of small groups elevated to positions
of absolute power by random pressures, and subject to political
and economic factors that leave little room for decision. They are
representatives of abstract forces who have reached power through
surrender of self. The iron-willed dictator is a thing of the past.
There will be no more Stalins, no more H iders. The rulers of this
most insecure of all worlds are rulers by accident, inept, frightened
pilots at the controls of a vast machine they cannot understand ,
calling in experts t o tell them which buttons t o push.
Junk is a key, a prototype of life. If anyone fully understood
junk, he would have some of the secrets of life, the final answers.
I have mentioned the increased sensitivity to dreamlike feelings
of nostalgia that always accompany light junk sickness. This morn­
ing when I woke up without junk, I closed my eyes and saw cliffs
on the outskirts of a town , with houses on top of them, and china­
blue sky, and white linen snapping in a cold spring wind.
The pure pleasure of cold Whistle on a hot summer afternoon
of my childhood. In the 1920s the United States, even the Midwest,
was a place of glittering possibilities. You could be a gangster, a
hard-dri nking reporter, a jittery stockbroker, an expatriate, a suc­
cessful writer. The possibilities spilled out in front of you like a
rich display of merchandise. Sitting on the back steps drinking
Whistle at twilight on a summer evening, hearing the streetcars
clang past on Euclid A venue, I felt the excitement and nostalgia
of the twenties tingling in my groin.

INTERZONE

71

Interesting that out of morphine has been made the perfect
antidote for morphine, and that it creates its exact antidote in the
body. And from junk sickness comes a heightened sensitivity to
impressions and sensation on the level of dream, myth, symbol.
On the penis there might be bits of flesh half-putrescent and half­
larval, separating from the host and degenerating to less specific
ti�sue, a sort of life jelly that will take root and grow anywhere.

Seemed to see West St. Louis, the moving headlights on Lindell
Boulevard. Very vivid for a moment. I was in a study with soft
lights, an apartment probably. Horrible feeling of desolation. Imag­
ine being old, paralyzed or blind, and forced to accept the charity
of some St. Louis relation. I continue writing, but publication is
hopeless. The book market is saturated. It is all done now by staff
writers and is as much a job as working in an advertising agency.
Not even anyone I can read it to, so that when I know it is good
I feel more sad because then the loneliness is sharper.
Would it be possible to write a novel based on the actual facts
of Interzone or anyplace?

Marv and Mohamed-this "friendship," as Sam calls it:
"Once he brought me a dead sparrow."
Marv's grating, continual laugh, his angular, graceless move­
ments. They could not be called clumsy. Quick, not fumbling, he
moves in galvanized, pathic jerks, never sliding into fluid grace,
or off the other edge into actual tic.
And Mohamed-sulky, stupid, whore to the bone. He is a fa­
vorite among the Arabs because of his chunky, fat ass. A fat ass
is considered highly desirable by the Arabs. How Oriental and
dull at the same time, like a carryover from camel trading.
So Marv says all the time: "I don't mind him going with Arabs,

72

Willie"' S.

Burrough•

you understand, but just don't let me catch him with another
American or a European. Better not let me catch either of them.
You have to fight for what you want in this world. "
I wonder i f Mohamed has any desires that are really his, that
is, starting from inside out and seeking the projection of his desire?
But they don't function that way. They are excited by situation,
not by fantasy. This is partly due to the immediate availability of
sex to the Arab, which is difficult for an American-accustomed
to frustration, certainly to delay, expense, buildup-to realize.
The Arab achieves immediate satisfaction because he is willing to
accept homosexual contact.
As Marv puts it: "It's three in the morning, so Ali meets Ahmed
and says to him: 'Do you want to?' That's the standard phrase.
The whole deal takes five minutes . " It's expected the one who
makes the proposition should give something to the other. A few
pesetas, some cigarettes. Anything. A matter of form. So perhaps
an Arab has no type he is looking for, no specialized desires at
all. Man or woman, it's all sex to him. Like eating. Something you
do every day.
No one I really want to see here. So far as friendship goes, I
can't live off the country. So few people I want to see anywhere.
KiKi is ten minutes' perfunctory talk or sex, and I am completely
unable most of the time on accounta the family jewels is in hock
to the Chinaman. Must cut down or kick. The price is going up
to where I can't pay. Since that fucking German had to come here
and commit suicide, you have to buy a script every time. Why
couldn't he have done it someplace else? Or some other way?
Waited all day until eight at night for two boxes.

A novel that consists of the facts as I see and feel them. How
can it have a beginning or an end? It just runs along for a while
and then stops, like Arab music.

INTERZONE

73

I can hear some Arabs singing in the next house. This music
goes on and on, up and down. Why don't they get bored with it
and shut up? It says nothing, goes nowhere. There is no lift in it,
no emotion. Sounds like a chorus of boys singing out lottery num­
bers, or a tobacco auction. Apparently they are beating a tam­
bourine, dancing and singing. Every now and then they reach a
meaningless climax and everybody lets out shrill yipes. Then they
stop for a while, presumably resting for another period of the same
routine. Is it sad, happy, sinister, sweet? Does it express any deep
human emotions? If so, I don't feel it.
I have wondered if it would be possible to find a note of music
that would produce orgasm in the listener, that would reach into
the spinal column and touch a long white nerve. Tension grows in
the abdomen and breaks in long waves through the body, colonic
undulations rising to a sudden crescendo. Arab music sounds like
that. An orgasm produced mechanically without emotion, a twang­
ing on the nerves, a beating on the viscera.

After a shot I went up to the Bagdad and met Leif and Marv.
The manager is an unsuccessful artist named Algren. If he has a
first name, I never heard it. Tall, broad-shouldered, handsome,
with a cold, imperious manner. When I first came to Interzone he
was exhibiting some of his paintings. Not distinguished work. Vis­
tas of the Sahara, the best of them recalling the bare, haunted
rock and desert of Dali's dream landscapes. There is skill, he can
draw but he has no real reason to do so. I found he was as niggardly
in putting out in personal relation as in painting. I could make no
contact with him. He lives with a young Arab painter, a phony
primitive. As a fashionable restaurateur, Algren is superb, just
the correct frequency of glacial geniality. He expects the joint to
become world-famous.
"Last night the coatroom was stacked with mink. There's a lot

74

William S.

Burrough•

of money in Interzone, " he says. Maybe, but it is a bit out of the
way. A rich old woman put up the loot. Algren doesn't have dime
one, but he's a character who will get rich by acting like he is
rich already. And Algren is crazy in a way that will help. He has
a paranoid conceit. He is a man who never has one good word to
say for anybody, and that's the way a man should be to run a
fashionable night spot. Everyone will want to be the exception ,
the one person he really likes.
He has some Arab musicians from the Rif, a three-man combo,
and a little boy who dances and sings. The kid is about fourteen
and small for his age, like all Arabs. There is no stir of adolescence
in his face, no ferment, nothing there to awaken. The face of an
old child, doll-like with a monkey's acquisitiveness. He puts the
money you give him in his turban so it hangs down on his forehead.
What does he do with the money? His voice is very loud, the up
and down of Arab music bellowed out by this grasping, whirling
doll. He twitches his hips not only sideways but up and over in a
peculiar, double-jointed movement. His sexual and acquisitive
drives are completely merged. It would never occur to him to go
to bed with anyone for a reason other than money. There is about
him a complete lack of youngness, of all the sweetness and un­
certainty and shyness of youth. He is hard and brassy as an old
whore, and to me about as interesting as a sexual object.
There is a nightmare feeling in Interzone with its glut of nylon
shirts, cameras, watches, sex and opiates sold across the counter.
Something profoundly menacing in complete laissez-faire. And the
new police chief up there on the Hill, accumulating dossiers-1
suspect him of unspeakable fetishistic practices with his files.
When the druggist sells me my daily ration of Eukodal, he smirks
like I have picked up the bait to a trap. The whole Zone is a trap,
and someday it will close. Not snap shut, but close slowly. We
will see it closing, but there will be no escape, no place to go.
Speaking of the new chief of police reminds me, when I first

I NTERZO N E

7 15

got here KiKi's mother beefed about me to the fuzz I was debauching
her only child, or so the story went. I was living in Matty's place,
and Matty swore it was true, and claimed there was a detective
prowling around outside the door-it turned out he wasn't a de­
tective at all but an old queen who had his eye on KiKi, and the
whole story was just Interzone bullshit. At the same time Antonio,
the mooching Portuguese, starts a rumor there is junk heat on me.
He hopes I will lam out of the Zone.
Matty is a pimp who loves his work, a fat, middle-aged, queer
Cupid. He kept casting reproachful glances at me in the hall: "Ach,
fifteen years in the Zone, and never before do I have such a thing
in my house. Now is here since two weeks an English gentleman.
With him I could make good business except my house is so
watched at. "
Bedroom farce of police and terrible mother coming i n the front
door. I try to push KiKi into Marv's room and he says: "Dump
your hot kids someplace else, Lee. " A handkerchief with come on
it is extremely damning evidence. The best thing is to swallow it.
I am writing this in a hospital where I am taking the cure again.
A typical Interzone setup. Jewish hospital, Spanish-run, with Cath­
olic sisters as nurses. Like everything Spanish it is run in a sloppy,
lackadaisical manner, thank God! No nurse walking in at the crack
of dawn to slop tepid water all over you. No good explaining to
some Swedish nurse from North Dakota how a junky can't stand
the feel of water on his skin. I been here ten days and haven't had
a bath. It is 8 A.M. and the day shift comes on sometime in the
next half hour. In the room next to me someone is groaning. A
horrible, inhuman sound, pushed out from the stomach. Why don't
they give him a shot and shut him up? It's a drag. I hate to hear
people groan, not because of pity but because it is a very irritating
sound.
That reminds me of a skit I once wrote about a junky whose
mother was dying of cancer, and he takes her morphine, substi-

78

William S.

Burrougha

tuting codeine. To substitute codeine was worse than stealing the
morphine outright and substituting milk-sugar placebo. A placebo,
by the shock, the gap between the pain-tom tissues straining for
the relief of morphine, and the sheer nothingness in the placebo,
might galvanize the body into a miracle, an immaculate fix . But
codeine would blunt the edge of pain so that it would liquefy and
spread, filling the cells like a gray fog, solid, impossible to
dislodge.
"Better now?" The groaning had stopped.
"Much better, thank you," she said dryly.

She knows, he thought. I could never fool her .

Perhaps one would feel better in an out-and-out police state like
Russia or satellite countries. The worst has happened. The outer
world realizes your deepest fears-or desires? You don't get bends
of the spirit from sudden changes of pressure. Inner and outer
pressure are equalized.
So I wrote a story about a man who gets the wrong passport in
a Turkish bath in the Russian Zone of Vienna, and he can't get
back through the Iron Curtain. Incomplete, of course. What you
think I am, a hack?

The sky over Vienna was a light, hard, china blue, and a cold
spring wind whipped Martin's loose gabardine topcoat around his
thin body. He felt the ache of desire in his loins, like a toothache
when the pain is light and different from any other pain. He turned
a corner; the Danube stabbed his eyes with a thousand points of
light, and he felt the full force of the wind and had to lean forward
to maintain balance.

If there's no guard at the line there can't be too much danger,
he thought. They could hardly accuse me of spying in a Turkish

INTERZONE

77

bath . He saw a cafe and went in. A huge room, almost empty.
Green upholstered seats like old Pullman cars. A sullen waiter
with a round pimply face and white eyelashes took his order for a
double brandy. He swallowed the brandy straight. For a moment
he gagged, then his stomach smoothed out in waves of warmth and
euphoria. He ordered another brandy. The waiter was smiling now.

,What the hell, he thought. A ll they could do is kick me out of
the Russian Zone .
He sat back anticipating the warm embrace of steam, letting go,
liquefying like an amoeba, dissolving in warmth and comfort and
desire.

Why draw the line anywhere? What a man wants to do he will
do sooner or later, in thought or in fact . . . . But nobody is giving
you an argument . The third brandy was anesthetizing the centers
of caution. I'm hard up and I want a boy, and I'm going to the

Roman Baths, Russian Zone or no . Too bad we didn't have a queer
representative when they split up Vienna . We'd have gone to the
barricades before Russia got the Roman Baths .
He saw a legion of embattled queens behind a barricade of
Swedish-modem furniture. They staggered and died with great
histrionic gestures and pathic screams. They were all tall, thin,
ungainly queens in Levi's and lumberjack shirts, with long yellow
hair and insane blue eyes, all screaming, screaming. He shud­
dered. Perhaps I'd better just go back to the hotel and . . . no,
by God!
The streetcar was crowded and he had to stand. The people
looked gray, hostile, suspicious, avoiding his glance. They were
passing the Prater. He was in the Russian Zone. He remembered
the Prater before the war, a huge park always full of people and
plenty of pickups. Now it was an expanse of rubble with one vast
Ferris wheel, bleak and menacing against the cold blue sky. He
got off the streetcar. The conductor stood leaning out of the back

78

Willian� S.

Burrough•

platform watching Martin until the streetcar turned the comer.
Martin pretended to look for a cigarette.
Yes, there were the Roman Baths, looking much the same. The
street was empty. Perhaps there would be no boys. But a youth
sidled up to him and asked for a light. Not too good, he decided.

I'll find better inside .
He paid for a room, leaving his wallet and passport in a de­
posit box.
(This is after he has got the wrong passport, been arrested and
deported to Budapest, or somewhere far behind the Iron Curtain. )
He learned a new kind of freedom, the freedom of living in
continual tension and fear to the limit of his inner fear and tension
so the pressure was at least equalized, and for the first time in his
adult life he knew the meaning of complete relaxation, complete
pleasure in the moment. He felt alive with his whole being. The
forces that were intended to crush his dignity and existence as an
individual delineated him so that he had never felt surer of his
own worth and dignity.
And he was not alone. Slowly he discovered a vast, dreamlike
underground: a cop examining his papers would suddenly tum into
a friend. And he learned the meaning of the hostile, averted faces
on the streetcar in Vienna, learned to distrust the friendship too
quickly offered.
Martin had lost fifteen pounds since leaving the West. His hand
rested now on his stomach, feeling the muscle hard and alive with
an animal alertness. Steps on the stairs. Two men, strangers. He
knew the step of everyone in the One World pension. He slid off
the bed. Moving with economy and precision, he shoved a heavy
wardrobe in front of the door. He crossed the room, opened the
window and stepped out onto the fire escape, closing the window
behind him. He climbed a shaky iron ladder to the roof. He heard
the wardrobe crash to the floor. Seven feet to the next roof. He

INTE RZ O N E

79

looked around. No plank, nothing. He heard the window open.

I'll have to jump, he decided.
(To be continued)

Went to bed with KiKi. He said he couldn't come because he
is all wore out from wet dreams about me the night before. That
really takes the rag offen the bush.
Developed routine during dinner with Kells Elvins. We kidnap
the Sacred Black Stone out of Mecca and hold it for ransom. We
swoop down in a helicopter, throw the Stone in and take off with
it like a great roc, the Arabs following the 'copter across the square,
reaching up at it and shouting imprecations. (Maybe the Stone is
too big to move?)

Lee sat with the syringe poised in his left hand, pondering the
mystery of blood. Certain veins he could hit at two-thirty in the
afternoon. Others were night veins, veins that appeared and dis­
appeared at random. Lee found his hunches were seldom wrong.
If he reached for the syringe with his right hand, it meant try the
left arm. His body knew what vein could be hit. He let the body
take over, as in automatic writing, when he was preparing to
pick up.
There was a single candle burning in a brass stick on the bed
table. KiKi and Lee lay side by side in bed, a sheet thrown across
their bodies waist high. They passed a keif cigarette back and
forth, inhaling deeply and holding the inhale. KiKi had a case of
benign shingles, and there was a great hive on his back and swelling
in the glands under his arms. Lee ran gentle fingers over the
inflamed area, asked questions, nodded gravely from time to time.
The candle light and smoke, the low voices, imparted a quality of
ritual to the scene. . .

Following is a story of a young man in Spain sentenced to be
hanged by a council of war (the military handles capital cases in
Spain):
Antonio sat down on the iron shelf covered with old newspapers
that was his bed. He lay down on his side and pulled his knees
up to his chest, hands pressed against his genitals.

A council of war! he thought. That completes the picture of a
barbarous, obscene ritual like an Indian tribe's . They've been trying
to get me like this ever since they found out I'd been born alive . But
I had an animal's feel for traps-until they found the right bait .
It was a clumsy snare, and I could have seen the noose under the
leaves that first night in Tio Pepe's . That is, I could have seen it if
I hadn't been looking someplace else . . . .
Fade out . . . Flash back . . . Music (obviously I have an eye
on TV and Hollywood) :
It was early for Tio Pepe's, which is a late place that gets going
when the bars close down, after one o'clock. No one at the bar. I
ordered a cognac. There was a boy standing in front of the jukebox.
He had on one of those summer shirts with holes in it, a white
shirt hanging outside his pants. Through the shirt, in a halo of
hideous man-made colors, chlorophyll greens, reds and oranges
of synthetic soft drinks, the purples of a fluorescent-lighted cocktail
lounge, the ghastly light pinks and blues of religious objects, I
could see the lean young body alive with an animal alertness. He
was leaning against the jukebox, his hip thrown to one side, his
face bent over, reading the song titles, all the awkwardness and
grace and sweetness of adolescence in his stance, those terrible
colors playing over him.

He looks like an advertisement for something, I thought, but that
wasn't exactly what I meant. There was some significance in the
young figure leaning over the jukebox that eluded me. Then he
turned around, pivoting with a sudden movement. I could hear my

own breath suck in with a sharp hiss of air. He didn't have any
face. It was a mass of scar tissue . . . .

I see the way to solve contradictions, to unite fragmentary,
unconnected projects: I will simply transcribe Lee's impressions
of Jnterzone. The fragmentary quality of the work is i nherent in
the method and will resolve itself so far as necessary. That is, I
include the author, Lee, in the novel, and by so doing separate
myself from him so that he becomes another character, central to
be sure, occupying a special position, but not myself at all. This
could go on in an endless serial arrangement, but I would always
be the observer and not the participant by the very act of writing
about a figure who represents myself.
I feel guilty writing this when I should be up to my balls in
work. But feller say: "Nothing is lost. " . . . A horrible vision of
suffocating under the accumulated piss and shit and nail clippings
and eyelashes and snot excreted by my soul and body, backing
up like atomic waste. "Go get lost for Chrissakes!" I already made
a novel outa letters. I can always tuck one in somewhere, bung
up a hole with it, you know . . . .
I hear that baneful, unfrocked Lt. Commander prowling about
the halls. They took his buttons off and cut his stripes away, but
unfortunately neglected to hang him in the morning or at any other
time. The reference, in case you are fortunate enough not to know,
is to "The Hanging of Danny Deever" by Kipling. For a real bum
kick you should hear a decaying, corseted tenor singing "The
Hanging of Danny Deever," followed by "Trees" as an unsolicited
encore.
Like I say, this fucking ex-Commander is casting a spell of
silliness over me so that I sometimes come up with these awful,
queer double entendres myself. Last night I told him straight, by
God I wasn't going to stand still for any more of his shit: "Don't

So I really had all I could take. And the typewriter is fucked
again. I'm a martyr to this fucking typewriter-a man as basically
unmechanical as I am should never buy used machinery-but
before I'll ask help from that Commander I'll write with blood and
a hypodermic needle.
Loaded on methadone. I bought out Interzone and the south end
of Spain on Eukodal. Like I say, loaded, impotent, convulsed with
disembodied limitless desire. Appointment with KiKi manana . I
am supposed to be taking the cure again. KiKi has my clothes and
money and is doling out ampules1 pulled a sneak. Pants borrowed off a clothesline, degage in a

dirty sweatshirt like returning from tennis or a hike on the moun­
tain, finally managed to cash one of my special traveler's checks.
Even my traveler's checks are wrong, vaguely disreputable and
disturbing. No one thinks they are actually forged or counterfeit,
you understand. They just feel something wrong with me.

A fat blond beast of a desk sergeant throwing himself at the feet
of a thin, crippled, red-haired lush worker: sparse red hair, the
junky gray felt hat which leaves a line on his forehead when he
takes it off-it is that tight. So this cop comes down from the
rostrum of his desk and grovels at the feet of this skinny little
middle-aged lush worker known as Red from Brooklyn, to distin­
guish him from another Red, who has no such definite and par­
ticularizing place of residence. Red shrinks back , expecting to get
worked over.
"Red !" A horrible sound of defeat, a sordid battle fought and
lost in a psyche as bleak as a precinct cell. "Reddie Boy!" He
makes a kissing bite for Red's shoe. Red retreats again.

I NTERZO N E

83

"Now, Lieutenant! I didn't so much as put my hand out."
The sergeant jumps up like a great albino toad. He reaches out
and grabs the trembling lush worker by the coat lapels.
"Lieutenant! Listen to me. I didn't. "
"Reddie Boy!" He throws his fat but powerful arms around Red,
pinioning both of Red's arms. He runs one hand up behind Red's
neck, kisses him brutally, repeatedly.
"Reddie Boy! How I've wanted you all these years! I remember
the first time you came in, with Dolan from the Fifteenth. Only it
wasn't the Fifteenth then, it was the Ninth . . . . "
Red gives a horrible, sickly, cautious smile. Thefuzz has.flipped.

I gotta play it cool . . . cool . . . .
"Many's the night I've cried for you like this, Reddie Boy . "
"Jeez, not that way, Sarge. I got piles . "
"You haven't been a naughty boy with someone else, have you?
Wonder if we could use this floor wax?" This last sentence in his
hard, practical cop voice.

Someone just died in the hospital downstairs. I can hear them
chanting something, and women crying. It's the old Jew who was
annoying me with his groans . . . . Well, get this stiff outa here.
It's a bringdown for the other patients. This isn't a funeral parlor.
What levels and time shifts involved in transcribing these notes:
reconstruction of the past, the immediate present-which condi­
tions selection of the material-the emergent future, all hitting me
at once, sitting here junk-sick because I got some cut ampules of
methadone last night and this morning.
I just went down to the head and passed the dead man's room.
Sheet pulled up over his face, two women snifHing. I saw him
several times, in fact this morning an hour before he died. An ugly
little man with a potbelly and scraggly, dirty beard, always groan­
ing. How bleak and sordid and meaningless his death!

God grant I never die in a fucking hospital! Let me die in some

louche bistro, a knife in my liver, my skull split with a beer bottle,
a pistol bullet through the spine, my head in spit and blood and
beer, or half in the urinal so the last thing I know is the sharp
ammonia odor of piss- I recall in Peru a drunk passed out in the
urinal. He lay there on the floor, his hair soaked with piss. The
urinal leaked, like all South American pissoirs, and there was half
an inch of piss on the floor- Or let me die in an Indian hut, on
a sandbank, in jail, or alone in a furnished room, on the ground
someplace or in an alley, on street or subway platform, in a wrecked
car or plane, my steaming guts splattered over tom pieces of metal.
. . . Anyplace, but not in a hospital, not in bed . . .
This is really a prayer. "If you have prayed, the thing may
chance. " Certainly I would be atypical of my generation if I didn't
die with my boots on. Dave Kammerer stabbed by his boy with a
scout knife, Tiger Terry killed by an African lion in a border-town
nightclub, Joan Burroughs shot in the forehead by a drunken id­
iot-myself.- doing a William Tell, trying to shoot a highball glass
off her head, Cannastra killed climbing out of a moving subway
for one more drink- His last words were "Pull me back !" His
friends tried to pull him back inside, but his coat ripped in their
hands and then he hit a post-Marvie dead from an overdose of
horse1 see Marvie in a cheap furnished room on Jane Street, where
I used to serve him-sounds kinda dirty, don't it?-1 mean sell
him caps of H, figuring it was better to deliver to his room than
meet him someplace, he is such a ratty-looking citizen , with his
black shoes and no socks in December. Once I delivered him his
cap, and he tied up. I was looking out the window-it is nerve­
racking to watch someone look for a vein. When I turned around
he had passed out, and the blood had run back into the dropper,
it was hanging onto his arm full of blood, like a glass leech- So
I see him there on the bed in a furnished room, slowly turning

INTERZ O N E

blue around the lips, the dropper full of blood clinging to his arm .
Outside it is getting dark. A neon sign flashes off and on, off and
on, each flash picking out his face in a hideous red-purple glow­
"Use Gimpie's H . It's the greatest!" Marvie won't have to hustle
tomorrow. He has scored for the Big Fix.
-Leif the Dane drowned with all hands in the North Sea-he
was a drag anyhoo. Roy went wrong and hanged himself in the
Tombs-he always used to say: "I don't see how a pigeon can live
with himself. " And P. Holt, the closest friend of my childhood,
cut his jugular vein on a broken windshield . . . dead before they
got him out of the car. A few of them died in hospitals or first-aid
stations, but they had already had it someplace else. Foster, one
of my anthropology friends in Mexico, died of bulbar polio. "He
was dead when he walked in the door," the doctor at the hospital
said later. "I felt like telling him, 'Why don't you check straight
into a funeral parlor, pick your coffin and climb into it? You've
got just about time. ' "

I've had trouble with this Spanish methadone before. Often I
have bought boxes with one or two empty ampules. Accident?
Spanish sloppiness? lxnay. These Spanish factories are flooding
Southern Europe with methadone.
Is it safer to put an empty ampule in every ten boxes or so, or
to fill all the ampules with adulterated mixture? Hard to say. People
are more likely to beef about empties, but it is easier to alibi.
Accidents can happen-though they shouldn't happen in a meth­
adone factory. Not that kind of accident. A beef is less likely with
an adulterated mixture, but more serious if it occurs, and somebody
who hasn't been paid off, or who has a political angle, starts making
spot analyses of the product. There is no alibi-ing that. And they
are getting too greedy. Last night's shot was plain water. That's
not smart.

The Man is getting edgy. His boy is squawking for a star sap­
phire: "Daddy, you wanna get the best for me. " His blonde wants
a custom-made Daimler so long it can't tum comers-only
also-rans tum comers. If you got real class to you, you never look
sideways. The bang-tails are running offbeat, some citizen un­
loaded a salted uranium mine on him. (The uranium mine is a new
con. You plant a tube of atomic waste in the mine site so the
Geiger counter goes wild over it. Or you can use a gimmicked
Geiger counter with an electric motor concealed in it so you can
speed it up or slow it down. )
My thoughts have been turning to crime lately. And of all crimes,
blackmail seems to me the most artistically satisfying. I mean, the
Moment of Truth when you see all his bluff and bluster and front
collapse, when you know you've got him. His next words-when
he can talk-will be: "How much do you want?" That must be
real tasty. A man could get his rocks off on a deal like that.
Like a guy pushed his boy off a balcony and claimed it was an
accident, the kid slipped on a gob of K-Y and catapulted over the
rail. No witnesses. He seems to be in the clear. Then Willy Lee
drops around.
Lee: "You see, Mr. Throckmorton, I'm broke. "
Throckmorton: "Broke! I don't know why you come to me with
this revolting disclosure. It's extremely distasteful. Have you no
pride?"
Lee: "I thought you might want to help a fellow American , and
buy this gadget off me. " He shows a German spy camera attached
to powerful field glasses for long-range pictures. "It's worth quite
a bit . "
Throckmorton: "Take i t to a pawnshop. I have n o interest in
photography. "
Lee: "But this is a very special gadget. Look from that balcony .
. . . Say, isn't that the balcony that kid fell from?"

I NTERZO N E

Throckmorton looks at him coldly. Lee stammers, pretends to
be embarrassed.
Lee: "Now I hope I haven't gone and said the wrong thing. Must
have been a terrible shock for you, losing a friend . . . and such
a good friend. . . . What I wanted to say was from that balcony
you can hardly see my trap over on the wrong side of the Medina,
but if I took a picture from that balcony it would show my place
and how dirty the windows are and how one has a broken pane
mended with adhesive tape . . . . "
Throckmorton (looking at his watch): "I'm not interested. Now
if you will excuse me, I have an appointment. . . . "
Lee: "I'm sorry to take up your time like this. . . . Like I was
saying, you could take a picture that would show my place, or you
could take a picture in the other direction-one that would show

your place. I've taken some pictures of your place, Mr. Throck­
morton. . . . I hope you won't think me presumptuous. " He pulls
out some photos. "I'm a pretty good photographer. Maybe you would
want to buy some of these pictures I took of your house and that
balcony. . . . "
Throckmorton: "Will you please leave my house. "
Lee: "But, Mr. Throckmorton, one of these pictures i s really
interesting. " He holds the picture three inches in front of Throck­
morton's face. Throckmorton starts back. A cry of anger dies away
to a gurgle in his throat. He reaches for a chair and collapses into
it, like an old man having a stroke.
Lee: "Like the song say, Mister Throckmorton, you're beginning
to see the light . . . . What's your first name, lover?" He sits on
the ann of Throckmorton's chair and playfully ruffles his hair. "I
got like a presentiment we're going to get to know each other real
well . . . see quite a bit of each other."

I have a feeling that my real work I can't or, on a deep level,
won't begin. What I do is only evasion, sidetrack, notes. I am
walking around the shores of a lake, afraid to jump in, but pre­
tending to study the flora and fauna-those two old bags. I must
put myself, every fucking cell of me, at the disposal of this
work.
Oh, God! Sounds like posthumous biographical material-Lee's
letters to his beloved friend and agent, who writes back that the
work must develop in its own way and reveal as much of itself to
me as I am able to interpret and transcribe. I have but to act with
straightaheadedness, without fear or holding back.
"At this time the creative energies of Lee were at lowest ebb.
He was subject to acute depressions. 'At times, ' he writes in a
letter to his agent , 'my breath comes in gasps, ' or again , 'I have
to remember to breathe. ' "
But the fragmentary, unconnected quality of my work is inherent
in the method, and will resolve itself as far as is necessary. The
Tangier novel will consist of Lee's impressions of Tangier, instead
of the outworn novelistic pretense that he is dealing directly with
his characters and situations. That is, I include the author in the

novel .

Civilian casualties of those books on combat judo and guerrilla
war. Country club cocktail party: A man who had been a great
athlete in his youth, still powerful but fattish, a sullen-faced ash
blond with droopy lips, stands in front of another man, looking at
him with stupid belligerence.
"Bovard, I could kill you in thirty seconds. No, in ten seconds.
I have a book on combat judo. . . . Like this-" He leaps on
Bovard, planting a knee in his back. "I hook my left middle finger
into your right eye, meanwhile my knee is in your kidney and I

around to stamp on your instep with . . . "

Sharp words with the criada . Half an hour past breakfast time,
I ring and ask for breakfast and the silly little bitch comes on sulky
and surprised, like I was out of line.
I say sharply: "Look , seiWrita" (there is no English equivalent
for seiWrita, which means a young, well-brought-up, unbanged
young lady, I mean a virgin; you even call sixty-year-old whores

seiWrita as a politeness-especially if you want something from
them, you dig, I shouldn't take it upon myself to imply she isn't

seiWrita)-so I say, "Look, seiWrita, breakfast is at eight. It's now
eight-thirty. "
I am not one of those weak-spirited , sappy Americans who want
to be liked by all the people around them. I don't care if people
hate my guts; I assume most of them do. The important question
is what are they in a position to do about it. My affections, being
concentrated on a few people, are not spread all over Hell in a
vile attempt to placate sulky, worthless shits.
Of course, they could cut off my junk. That happened once and
I beefed loud, long and high up, straight to the head croaker of
this crummy trap. (I'm about the only cash customer they got. If
I'd claimed to be half-Jewish I would be here for free. ) My purpose
in beefing was just in case somebody on the premises lifted the
ampule and give me a shot of water, though the stuff was prob­
ably cut at the factory like Jewish babies, like all babies now.
There is a night nurse who looks like junk , but it's hard for
me to be sure with women and Chinese. Anyhoo, she give me a
shot of water one night and I don't want her ministering to me
no more-Actually I savor like old brandy, rolling it on my tongue, the
impotent hate of people who cannot, dare not retaliate. That is,

you dig, if I am in the right putting them down, if they really have
come up lousy. My epitaph on Old Dave the Pusher who died last
year in Mexico, D . F. : "He looks like junk as he would catch
another user in his strong toils of grace. "
This place is mad . There are six people in my room now, washing
the floor, putting up a mirror, taking the bed out and putting another
one in, hanging curtains, fixing the light switch, all falling over
each other and yelling in Spanish and Arabic, and the piss-elegant
electrician only deigns to speak French-in Interzone it is a sign
of class to speak nothing but French. You ask a question in Span­
ish, they answer in French , which is supposed to put you in your
place. Citizens who come on with the "I only speak French" routine
are the sorriest shits in the Zone, all pretentious, genteel-with
the ghastly English connotation of lower-middle-class phony
elegance-and generally don't have franc one. This electrician
looks like a walking character armor with nothing inside it. I can
see some Reichian analyst who has succeeded in dislodging the
electrician's character armor. The analyst staggers back, blasted,
blighted, a trembling hand covers his eyes: "Put it back! For the
love of Christ, put it back!"
I met Mark Bradford, the playwright. He says: "I didn't catch
your name . "
"William Lee . "
"Oh!" He drops m y hand. "Well . . . uh, excuse me. " He left
Interzone the following day.
To a person in the medium of success, Willy Lee is an ominous
figure. You meet him on the way down. He never hits a place when
it is booming. When Willy Lee shows, the desert wind is blowing
dust into empty bars and hotels, jungle vines are covering the oil
derricks. A mad realtor sits in a spectral office, a famished jackal
gnaws his numb, gangrenous foot: "Yes sir," he says, "this de­
velopment is building right up. "
A successful composer says to his protege, a young Arab poet:

91

"Start packing, Titmouse. I just saw Willy Lee in the Sacco Chico.
Interzone has had it. "
"Why, is he dangerous? You don't have to see him. "

"See him-I should think not. It's like this: A culture gets its
special stamp--Mayan, Northwest Coast, North Pacific-probably
from one person or small group of people, who originally exuded
these archetypes. Mter that, the archetypes are accepted un­
changed for thousands of years. Well, Lee goes around exuding
his own archetypes. It isn't done anymore. Already the Interzone
Cafe reeks of rotting, aborted, larval archetypes. You notice that
vibrating soundless hum in the Socco? That means someone is
making archetypes in the area and you'd best evacuate right now .
. . . Look, I am a success because I mesh with existing archetypes.
If I accept, or even get to know, Lee's archetypes .

. . and his

routines! ! !" The composer shudders. "Not me. Get packing, we're
meeting Cole in Capri . "

I just lit u p. . . . A very dangerous party, Miss Green. Just one
long drag on the unnatural teat she's got under her left ann and
you are stoned, Pops. . . . In Mexico once I picked up on some
bum-kick weed, and then got on a bus. I had a small pistol, a
.41- caliber double-barreled Remington derringer in a holster
tucked i nside my belt so it was pointing just where the leg joins
the body. . . . Suddenly I could feel the gun go off, smell the
powder smoke, the singed cloth, feel the horrible numb shock,
then the pit-pat of blood dripping like piss on the floor. . . . Later
I examined the gun and found the safety half-cock was broken and
such accidental discharge was quite possible.

who worked on Sundial, that left-wing tabloid. -You recall the
rag folded when their angel, an Albanian condom tycoon who came
on like an English gentleman-the famous Merchant of Sex, who
scandalized the International Set when he appeared at the Due du
Ventre's costume ball as a walking prick covered by a huge con­
dom-went broke and shot himself during World War II. He
couldn't get rubber, and Alcibiades Linton, the Houston Bubble
Gum King, beat him out on Mexican chicle-perhaps these long
parentheses should be relegated to footnotes. -1 don't know why
Chris married her. Probably for the looks of the thing, not knowing
exactly how such things do look. . . . Did I ever tell you about
my New Yorker cartoon? One State Department pansy visiting an­
other. Kids crawling all over both of them, so the visiting swish
says to the other: "Really, my dear, this front thing can be carried

bandit. So Chris comes back with his dead wife in a jeep and says:
"Poor Rachel. She was the life of every party. Kurds, you know . "
Kurds indeed. He liquidated her o n orders from Moscow. Fact is,
she "had taken to living on a slope of aristocracy," and ultimately

Typical Interzone conversation: "My dear, let me tell you where
you can buy the most marvelous cakes. Doughnut dough outside,
hot custard filling, and rolled in sugar . . . Just opposite the Mecca

the cakes, who by the way is available. "
Incredibly ugly and bestial women come down from the moun­

we'll have to pigeonhole that under "Mysteries of the East." Our

Above notes under file head T. B. W. I.-To Be Weaved In .
A routine starts here concerning a rich writer who employs an
extensive staff to do menial work like "weaving. " I have a group
of men and women, "My Eager Little Beavers" as I call them . . . .
So this writer is a sadistic tyrant, you dig? I come and supervise
the work, maintaining the nauseous fiction they really are beavers,
and they have to wear beaver suits and stand for a roll call . . .

"And watch you don't get caught when a tree falls," I say jovially,

Sort of a horrible tour de force, like the books of Anthony
Burgess. Nobody gives those people who write children's books
credit for what they have to go through. I have discovered a certain

84

W i l l i a m S.

Burrough•

writer of children's books is a great Kafkian figure. He chose to
hide himself in children's stories as a joke.
For example, there was a story of Old Grumpy Stubbs, who said
he needed subsidiary personalities-Subs, he calls them-to keep
his psyche cleaned out and perform other menial chores around
the "farm. "
"So just sign here, my friend. You'll never regret this as long
as you live . "
But poor Albrecht the woodcutter did regret i t as soon a s h e got
back to his little proviso apartment-that is, an apartment that has
already been leased to someone else, or on which the lease has
expired, so you can only hope to stall a few days until they get
the necessary papers for dispossessing you. Albrecht had lived in
provisos all his life.
Well, even though he couldn't read Clause 9(v) of the contract­
which can only be deciphered with an electron microscope and a
virus filter-Albrecht knew somehow he had done a terrific thing
to sell out to Old Stubbs, so called because he had cut off all but
two of his fingers in an effort to amuse his constituents: "I get it
back!" he would say, jovially rubbing his mutilated hands together.
"I get it back!"
"I just don't know," Albrecht reflected. "Now Old Stubbs he
talks real nice and he did cut off a thumb for me. . . . It isn't
every Sub can say he got a thumb off the old man. Some of them
didn't get nothing. "

An Adve rtising Short for Te levis ion :

"So there they are, these two young kids, naked in a jungle clearing
under a great, cheesy moon so big and close, like a big soft white
ass, you dig me? Like you could reach right up and goose it, and

all around the myriad sounds of the jungle night. They have found
the Lost City in each other's arms.
"Well, do they get living et by mosquitoes?" (These lapses into
faulty syntax are carefully cultivated by J. R. , the Director. He is
starting a J. R. legend, you dig?) "Do they wake up in the morning
with their assholes swoll shut they can't shit? Not at all. They wake
up in the magic of a jungle morning. A cool breeze gooses them
gently, running light fingers over their lean, hard young bodies.
Half in sleep, they begin to move in rhythmic contractions . . . .
"Well, the Hays Office steps in here, boys. They would have
stepped in last night, but the Assistant Coordinate Censor fell out
of the launch watching an Indian boy jack off in his dugout, and
a candiru skedaddled up his prick and we had to roust out a witch
man to extract the little varmint. " (The candiru is a little eel-like
critter about two inches long by one-quarter inch in diameter, that
darts up your prick, ass, or a woman's cunt if he can't do any
better, holding himself in situ by barbs. Just what he figures to
gain by this maneuver is not known, and no martyrs have stepped
forward to study the candiru's life cycle on location.)
"So why aren't they attacked by the whining hordes? Does love
protect them? Balls! They use the new DuPont 8-hour B-22 Insect
Repellent, that's why. You too can shit or fuck in comfort from
the jungles of Madagascar to the great Arctic marshes of Lapland,

water, turning his simian profile to ignore the waiter's look of cold
contempt.
"Bill, I hate to bother you with the tragedies of my life. The life
of a European filled with sickness and hunger. " He coughed.
"Americans are not able to understand these things . . . . You­

"Yes. And liver and lungs and a stomach. What's on your greasy
mind? As if I didn't know . . . "
Antonio did not notice. He was looking into space, his face
twisted with monkey-like hate.
"Yah ! To you Americans I am just a little performing monkey
who will do dirty little tricks for a penny. Less than a penny . . .
I remember when I am fourteen years old, two drunken American
merchant marines have me to jack off at their cafe table in a
crowded street in Lisbon. 'Guess I win the bet, Joe . ' 'Yeah, I guess
you do. I've seen everything now. ' And he passed over a wad of
escudos that would feed a Portuguese family for a year. 'How much
is this in money, Joe?' He holds up a coin like this . . . . " Antonio
made an ugly gesture, pinching thumb and forefinger together­
Lee was used to Antonio, but sometimes the man gave him a shock
with some indescribable twist of malevolent ugliness.
" 'Oh, about one fifth of a cent. '
" 'You think that's too much? I don't want to spoil him . '
" 'Oh hell. Might as well spread around a little goodwill . '
" 'Trouble is the little gook might go into convulsions of gratitude
and die right here at the table. Haven't you got anything smaller?'
" 'Wait a minute. Yeah, here we are. Rock bottom. Throw it
over there in that horse manure. ' "
Antonio's imitation of American accents was perfect, like a

recording, but mixed. Brooklyn and Chicago, California, East
Texas, Maine and the Deep South, the voice's absent owner ap­
pearing momentarily at the table, like a speeded-up superimposed
movie.
The waiter set the glass of water down with a smack so that
some of the water jumped out onto Antonio's sleeve. Antonio glared
at the waiter, who flicked the table with a towel, then turned his
back and walked away.
"Gratitude you want. We pick your coin out of dung with our
teeth, and then, shit running down our chins, we should kiss your
fine, long-wearing American boots, and say, 'Oh thank you,
Johnny. Thank you for your generosity . . . . That you condescend
to watch a European of noble family fuck his blood sister and that
my performance could find favor in your sight. This I did not dare
to hope for. . . . You are indeed kind. . . . ' "
His voice rose to a piercing shriek. Lee looked up, vaguely
annoyed.
"I, with seven-hundred-year-old blood in my veins! I, to kiss
the feet of a son-of-a-bitch American peasant pig!"
He was spitting with rage, like an hysterical cat. Suddenly his
plate flew out and he thrust his head forward, snapping for it. Lee
glimpsed a horrible extension of Antonio's mouth, teeth on the end
of a flesh tube, undulating across the table, silent, sinister and
purposeful as a parasitic worm.
The plate slid across the table into Lee's lap. Lee flicked the
plate back onto the table, snapping the cloth of his pants. Antonio
picked it up and polished it on the tablecloth with one hand. With
the other hand he kept his face covered. He replaced the teeth,
kneading his face. Finally he turned on Lee a ghastly smile, his
face yellow like dirty old wax, sweating with strain.
"But you are not like the other Americans. You are a . . .
good guy. "

"Did you ever think of working, young man?" Lee asked.
"In Tangier is no work. "
"Well, I know the owner of the Cafe de Ia Paix. I might could
get you on as a part-time lavatory attendant. After all, it's honest,
respectable work, and there's a future in it. He's thinking of putting
in a shoeshine parlor, and you might work right into a bootblack
job. That is, if you apply yourself, keep your eye on the ball . . . .
When an American finishes shitting, don't just stand there, wipe
his ass. And wipe it better than it was ever wiped before. "
Antonio glared at Lee. Lee smiled. His face ghastly with strain ,
hate streaming out of his eyes like a malevolent shortwave broad­
cast, Antonio smiled back.
"You are joking, Bill . "
"Sure. We're great kidders, u s Americans. "
"Americans! They come to Europe and buy us like cattle! 'You're
in the wrong hole, Clem. That's a he-gook you got there . ' 'So what,
Luke? 'Tain't as if it was being queer. After all, they's only gooks.'
"You cannot understand what it means, Bill. You do not come
from an old family. To have seen my great-aunt Mitzi, the Dowager
Countess of Borganzola, the proudest family in Europe, an old lady
of eighty years, dancing the can-can for drunken American sol­
diers. 'Shake the lead out, grandma. I got money on your ass . '
And I stand there helpless. I hate them s o almost I cannot pass
around the hat. "
"Okay," Lee said. "I'll take over the script now. Your old mother
is gaping like a fish, locked out of her iron lung for nonpayment
of rent. The finance company is repossessing your wife's artificial
kidney . . . . It's going to be tough, sitting there watching her swell
up and tum black, drowning in her own piss, your darling wife,
the mother of your dead son, last of the noble line of Borganzola,
and the croaker said just one more day with the kidney and she
is functioning again. A sad, sweet, resigned smile . . . 'Ah well

. . . My life has been one long tragedy. But to think that only fifty
pesetas would save her! It is too cruel!'
"You express the dilemma of the European, Antonio. You hate
us so much almost you cannot pass around the hat. "

Disp laced Fuzz

A drastic simplification of U . S. law has thrown thousands of cops
and narcotics agents out of work: The DFs-Displaced Fuzz­
overran the Placement Center, snarling and whimpering like tooth­
less predators: "I don't ask much out of life. Just let me give some
citizen a bad time . "
A few of them were absorbed by Friendly Finance:
DF 1: "Now, lady, we wouldn't want to repossess the artificial
kidney, what with your kid in such a condition like that, not being
able to piss . "
D F 2: "Anna innarest. "
D F 1 : "Anna carrying charges. "
D F 2: "Anna upkeep."
DF 1 : "Anna wear and tear onna appliance. "
D F 2: "Depreciation, whyncha?"
DF 1 : "Check, and the depreciation. "
D F 2: "It's like you're delinquent already . . . . Mmmm. Quite

D F 1 : "Quite a gadget ."
DF 2: "Not the sort of thing you could make out of an old washing
machine in your basement."
DF 1 : "If you had an old washing machine."
DF 2: "Anna basement."
Lady: "But what am I to do? I been replaced by the automation. "
D F 2: "I'm not Mr. Anthony, lady . . . . "
DF 1 : "You might peddle the kid's ass if he'll stand still for it,

haw haw haw . . . . Lady, we'd like to help you . . . . You see--"
DF 2 : "-We got a job to do is all. You should be able to save
sumpin'. "
D F 1 : "Maybe he pisses it all down the drain. Haw haw haw. "

A DF can still get his kicks with Friendly Finance. But what
about the other DFs?
One of them obtained a sinecure as lavatory attendant in a
Greyhound terminal and maintained his self-respect by denouncing
occasional improprieties and attempts to tamper with or circumvent
the pay toilets. To this end he concealed himself in the towel
receptacle, peeking out through a hinged slot.
Another worked in a Turkish bath and equipped himself with
infrared binoculars: "All right, you there in the north corner. I see
you . " He couldn't actually denounce the clients or throw them out,
but he did create such an unnerving ambiance--prowling about
the halls, poking into the steam room , switching on floodlights,
sticking his head into the cubicles through hinged panels in the
walls and floors-that many a queen was carried out in a strait­
jacket. So he lived out a full life and died at an advanced age of
prostate cancer.
Another was not so fortunate. For a while he worked as a con­
cierge, but he harried the tenants beyond endurance, so they finally
banded together and were preparing to burn him alive in the fur­
nace--w hich he habitually either over- or understoked-when the
police intervened. He was removed from office for his own pro­
tection. He then secured a position as a subway guard, but was
summarily dismissed for using a sharpened pole to push people
into the cars during the rush hour. He subsequently worked as a
bus driver, but his habit of constantly looking around to see what
the passengers were doing precipitated a wreck , from which he
emerged shattered in mind and body. He became a psychopathic

I NTERZO N E

1 01

informer, writing interminable letters to the FBI which J. Edgar
used as toilet paper, being of a thrifty temperament. He sank ever
lower and ended up Latah for cops, and would spend his days in
front of any precinct that would tolerate his presence, having been
barred from the area in and about Police Headquarters as a no­
torious bringdown.

Spare Ass An nie

When I became captain of the town, I decided to extend asylum
to certain citizens who were persona non grata elsewhere in the
area because of their disgusting and disquieting deformities.
One was known as Spare Ass Annie. She had an auxiliary asshole
in the middle of her forehead, like a baneful bronze eye. Another
was a scorpion from the neck down. He had retained the human
attribute of voice and was given to revolting paroxysms of self-pity
and self-disgust during which he would threaten to kill himself by
a sting in the back of the neck. He never threatened anyone else,
though his sting would have caused instant death.
Another, and by far the most detrimental, was like a giant
centipede, but terminated in human legs and lower abdomen.
Sometimes he walked half-erect, his centipede body swaying ahead
of him. At other times he crawled, dragging his human portion as
an awkward burden. At first sight he looked like a giant, crippled
centipede. He was known as the Centipeter, because he was con­
tinually making sexual advances to anyone he could corner, and
anyone who passed out was subject to wake up with Centipete in
his bed. One degenerate hermaphrodite known as Fish Cunt Sara
claimed he was the best lay in town: "Besides, he's a perfect
gentleman in every sense of the word. He's kind and good, which
means nothing to the likes of you. . . . "
These creatures had developed in a region where the priests

1 02

W i l liam S.

Burrough•

carried out strange rites. They built boxes from the moist, fresh
bones of healthy youths, captives from neighboring tribes. The
boys were killed by looping a vine noose around their necks and
pushing them off the branch of a giant cypress tree. The branch
had been cut off and carved in the form of an enormous phallus,
being some fifteen feet long and three feet in circumference. The
vine (always a yage plant) was attached to the end of the branch,
and the youth was led out and pushed off so that he fell about
eight feet, breaking his neck. Then the priests pounced on him,
while he was still twitching in orgasmic convulsions, and cut
through the flesh with copper knives, tearing out the bones. From
these bones they made boxes with great skill and speed, lining the
boxes with copper. Runners were dispatched to carry the boxes to
a certain high peak where peculiar lights were given off by the
rocks. Pregnant women were placed in the boxes and left on the
peak for a period of three hours. Often the women died, but those
who survived usually produced monsters. The priests considered
these monstrosities a way of humiliating the human race before
the gods, in the hope of diverting their anger.
These horrible freaks were highly prized, and they lived in the
temple. The women who gave birth to the most monsters received
gold stars, which they were authorized to wear on ceremonial
occasiOns.
Once a month they held a great festival at which everyone gath­
ered in a round stone temple, open at the top, and prostrated
themselves on the floor, assuming the most disgusting and degraded
positions possible, so that the gods would see they were not at­
tempting to elevate themselves above their station.
The habit of living in filth and humiliation finally occasioned a
plague, a form of acute leprosy, that depopulated the area. The
surviving freaks (who seemed immune to the plague) I decided to
receive as an object lesson in how far human kicks can go.

The Dream Cops

There was a sudden thunder of knocks on the door. The Agent
pulled on his trousers and turned the key in the lock. Three men
pushed into the room. Two were in plain clothes, one in uniform.
The man in uniform immediately pulled a pair of handcuffs out of
his pocket and twisted them around the Agent's wrists. The hand­
cuffs were made of a tough pliable wood. His uniform was tom
and spotted, the tunic twisted and buttoned in the wrong holes.
One of the plainclothesmen looked like a vaudeville-house de­
tective, with derby and cigar. The cigar was ten inches long. The
other plainclothesman was tall and thin and carried an instrument
that looked like a slide rule.
"The cigar's too long," said the Agent. "A dream cigar. You
can't touch me. "
The house detective nodded to the uniformed cop. The cop
showed dirty steel teeth in a snarl. He hit the Agent across the
mouth. The Agent could taste the blood.
"You have some peculiar dreams," said the detective. "Besides,
we can dream too . . . . Sleeping with a nigger. "
The Agent was about to deny this, but when he turned to look
there was a young Negro in his bed. Huge lice crawled in and out
of the Negro's greasy, frizzled hair.
"All right," said the detective. "Let's see your arm. "
The Agent rolled up the sleeve of his sweatshirt. Sparks exploded
behind his eyes. Blood ran down his chin. He got up, looking at
the house detective.
"Wise guy, eh?" the house detective snarled, his eyes phos­
phorescent, his mouth slavering. "You're the wisest prick I ever
walked in on. Let's see your arm . Your short arm . "
H e reached out a hairy hand as thick as it was wide, and grabbed
the Agent's belt. With the other hand he ripped open the Agent's
fly. The buttons rolled across the floor. He held the Agent's penis

judicially between thumb and forefinger. He turned to the other
plainclothesman-glen-plaid suit, skin tight and smooth and red
over his face, bad teeth. Smoking a cigar shaped like a cigarette.
He had been taking down the number on the Agent's kerosene
stove.
"Sixty percent of them are Jews, " said the house detective.
"I'm not Jewish," said the Agent.
"Sure, I know. You fucked one of those characters eats glass
and razor blades and circumscribed yourself. Not Jewish!"
The other detective looked up from the kerosene stove and
laughed sycophantically. A gold filling fell out on the floor.
At a signal from the house detective, the uniformed cop took
the handcuffs off.
"Watch your step," said the house detective. The three men
went out, closing the door.
Next morning the Agent's mouth was still sore. Lighting the
kerosene stove, he found a gold filling.

THE CONSPIRACY
Yes, they know we'll wait. How many hours, days, years, street
comers, cafeterias, furnished rooms, park benches, sitting, stand­
ing, walking? . . . All those who wait know that time and space
are one. How long-far to the end of the block and back? How many
games of solitaire make an hour? . . . Then time will suddenly
jump, slip ahead. This happens usually in the late afternoon, after
four o'clock. From one to four you hit on the slowest time.
I was reexamining candidates, proceeding by elimination, to
isolate the name. Yes, I thought, that is correct procedure. At the
same time, I knew the name would probably be a dark horse,

1 08

someone I hadn't thought of, like the man who says, "Why didn't
you come to me? I'd have lent you the money," and you know he
would have lent it. It was someone like that I was looking for,
while the logical elimination of prospects went on:
Gardiner? I wonder how he would manage to tum me in without
picking up a phone and calling the law? By getting arrested
himself? By telling someone who was sure to talk?
Marvin? At least he would say: "Bill, I can't do it. I won't take
the risk. You'll have to get out. "
Anyone who would do it for money was out. There would be
more money on the other side. Two cops. That can scare up $5,000
overnight. (Why is killing a cop such a heinous crime in America?
It isn't so in Mexico or South America. Because Americans accept
cops at their own valuation, as they accept anyone who has the
means of force.)
"Not a man of my acquaintance, that I'm sure of.

"

("Is this your final report?")
Not a man . . . not a man . . . . Well, how about a woman? . . .
A woman? Well . . . Mary! That was the name, the answer.
I told the driver to stop. We were passing 72nd Street. I got
out, paid the cab back to Washington Square, and waved good­
bye to Nick , still in the cab.
I took the subway up to l l6th Street and walked across the
Columbia campus to Mary's flat. Why didn't I think of her first?
A university campus-the perfect hideout. And I could count on
Mary, count on her 100 percent. The building was a four-story
brownstone. The windows shone clean and black in the morning
sunlight. I walked up three flights and knocked on the door. Mary
opened it and stood there looking at me.
"Come in, " she said, her face lighting up. "Want a cup of
coffee?" I sat down with her at the kitchen table and drank coffee
and ate a piece of coffee cake.
"Mary, I want to hide out here for a while. I don't know how

long exactly. You can say someone rented the extra room to write
his thesis. He doesn't want to go out of the room or see anyone
till it's finished. You have to buy his food and bring it to him.
He's paying you one hundred dollars to stay there three weeks, or
however long it takes. I just killed two detectives. "
Mary lit a cigarette. "Holdup?"
, "No. It's much more complicated than that. Let's move to the
living room, in case somebody comes. I'll tell you about it . . . .
"Light junk sickness, when I wake up needing a shot, always
gives me a sharp feeling of nostalgia, like train whistles, piano
music down a city street, burning leaves . . . . I mentioned this to
you, didn't I?"
Mary nodded. "Several times . "
"An experience w e think of a s fleeting, incalculable, coming
and going in response to unknown factors. But the feeling appears
without fail, in response to a definite metabolic setup. It's possible
to find out exactly what that setup is and reproduce it at will, given
sufficient knowledge of the factors involved. Conversely it is pos­
sible to eliminate nostalgia, to occlude the whole dreaming, sym­
bolizing faculty."
"And you mean it's been done?"
"Exactly. Scientists have perfected the anti-dream drug, which
is, logically, a synthetic variation on the junk theme. . . . And
the drug is habit forming to a point where one injection can cause
lifelong addiction. If the addict doesn't get his shot every eight
hours he dies in convulsions of oversensitivity."
"Like nerve gas."
"Similar. In short, once you are hooked on the anti-dream drug,
you can't get back. Withdrawal symptoms are fatal. Users are
dependent for their lives on the supply, and at the same time, the
source of resistance, contact with the myth that gives each man
the ability to live alone and unites him with all other life, is cut

1 08

off. He becomes an automaton, an i nterchangeable quantity in the
political and economic equation. "
"Is there an antidote?"
"Yes. More than that, there is a drug that increases the sym­
bolizing faculty. It's a synthetic variation of telepathine or yageine,
the active principle of Bannisteria caapi."
"And where do you come in?" Mary asked.
"Five years ago I made a study of Bannisteria caapi-the Indians
called it Y age, Ayauhuasca, Pilde-in South America, and found
out something about the possible synthetic variations. The sym­
bolizing or artistic faculty that some people are born with-though
almost everyone has it to some degree as a child-can be increased
a hundred times. We can all be artists infinitely greater than
Shakespeare or Beethoven or Michelangelo. Because this is pos­
sible, the opposite is also possible. We can be deprived of symbol­
making power, a whole dimension excised, reduced to completely
rational nonsymbolizing creatures. Perhaps . . . "
"Yes?"
"I was wondering whether . . . Well, let it go. We have enough
to think about."
That afternoon Mary went out and bought the papers. There was
no mention of Hauser and O'Brien.
"When they can keep that quiet they must have a fix in near
the top. With the ordinary apparatus of law looking for me, I might
have one chance in a hundred; this way . . . "
I told Mary to go to a pay phone in Times Square, call police
headquarters and ask for Hauser. Then go across the street and
see what happens. She was back in half an hour.
"Well?"
She nodded. "They stalled me, said to hang on a minute, he
was on the way. So I cut across the street. Not more than three
minutes later a car was there. Not a police car. They blocked both

entrances to the drugstore-! called from the drugstore-two went
in and checked the phone booths. I could see them questioning
the clerk, and he was saying in pantomime: 'How should I know?
A thousand people in and out of here every day. ' "
"And now you're convinced I'm not having a pipe dream? I wish
I could have one. Haven't seen any gum in a dog's age. . . . "
,"So what do we do now?"
"I don't know. I'd better start at the beginning and bring you
up to date."
What was the beginning? Since early youth I had been searching
for some secret, some key by which I could gain access to basic
knowledge and answer some of the fundamental questions. Just
what I was looking for, what I meant by basic knowledge or fun­
damental questions, I found it difficult to define. I would follow a
trail of clues. For example, the pleasure of drugs to the addict is
relief from the state of drug need. Perhaps all pleasure is relief
and could be expressed by a basic formula. Pleasure must be
proportional to the discomfort or tension from which it is the relief.
This holds for the pleasure of junk. You never know what pleasure
is until you are really junk-sick.
Drug addiction is perhaps a basic formula for pleasure and for
life itself. That is why the habit, once contracted, is so difficult
to break, and why it leaves, when broken, such a vacuum behind.
The addict has glimpsed the formula, the bare bones of life, and
this knowledge has destroyed for him the ordinary sources of sat­
isfaction that make life endurable. To go a step further, to find out
exactly what tension is, and what relief, to discover the means of
manipulating these factors . . . The final key always eluded me,
and I decided that my search was as sterile and misdirected as
the alchemists' search for the philosopher's stone. I decided it was
an error to think in terms of some secret or key or formula: the
secret is that there is no secret.

110

William S. Burrougha

But I was wrong. There is a secret, now in the hands of ignorant
and evil men, a secret beside which the atomic bomb is a noisy
toy. And like it or not, I was involved. I had already ante'd my
life. I had no choice but to sit the hand out.

IRON VVRAC K DREAM
This is one of the worst habits I ever kicked. I sit for an hour in
a chair, unable to get .up and fix myself a cup of tea.
Early this morning, half awake, shivering in a light junk-sick
fever, I had a vivid dream-fantasy. The hypersensitivity of junk
sickness is reflected in dreams during withdrawal-that is, if you
can sleep.
In the dream, I go to an elaborate house on a high cliff over
the sea. An iron door opens in a limestone cliff, and you get to
the house in a swift, silent elevator.
I have come to see a sexless character who wears men's clothes

1 12

but may be man or woman. Nobody knows for sure. A gangster of
the future, with official recognition and arbitrary powers.
He walks toward me as if about to shake hands. He does not
offer his hand . "Hello," he says. "Hello . . . there. "
The room is surrounded on three sides by a transparent plastic
shell.
"You will want to see the view," he says. A plastic panel slides
back . I step out onto a limestone terrace cut from the solid rock
of the cliff. No rail or wall. A heavy mist, but from time to time
I can see the waves breaking on the rocks a thousand feet below.
See the waves, but I don't hear them, like a silent film. Two
bodyguards are standing a few feet behind me.
"It gives the sensation of flying," I say.
"Sometimes . "
"Well, feller say only angels have wings," I say recklessly. I
tum around. I say, "Excuse me. " The bodyguards don't move.
They are standing with their backs to him. He is arranging flowers
in an obscene alabaster bowl. The guards cannot see him and he
says nothing, makes no sound, but a signal has been given. The
guards step aside to let me pass, back into the room.
I walk up to the table where he is arranging flowers. "I want to
know where Jim is," I say.
"Mmm. Yes. I suppose you do. "
"Will you tell me?"
"Maybe Jim doesn't want to see you . "
"If h e doesn't, I want t o hear it from him. "
"I never give anything for nothing. I want your room m the
Chimu. I want you out of there by nine tomorrow morning. "
"All right. "
"Go to 60 at Fourth Street, coordinate 20, level l6, YH room 72. "
The City i s a vast network of levels, like the Racks, connected
by gangways and cars that run on wires and single tracks. You
put a coin in a vacant car and it will take you anywhere on its

INTERZO N E

1 13

track or wire. Everyone carries an instrument called a coordinator,
to orient himself.
The City is in the U . S. The forces of evil and repression have
run their course here. They are suffocating in their armor or ex­
ploding from inner pressure. New forms of life are germinating in
the vast, rusty metal racks of the ru ined City.
It takes me twelve hours to find the address. A padded hammer
hangs from a copper chain on the door. I knock.
A man comes to the door: bald, looks like an old actor on the
skids. Effeminate, but not queer. A dumpy, middle-aged woman
is sitting in a purple velvet brocaded chair left over from 1910.
She looks good-natured. I say I want to see Jim.
"And who might you be?" the man asks.
"I'm Bill . "
H e laughs. " He's Bill, Gertie. " He turns t o me. "Someone was
just here asking for Bill. "
"How long ago?"
"Just five minutes," the woman says.
"Can I stay five minutes?" I ask. "I mean, if someone was here
five minutes ago asking for Bill, and now I am here asking for Jim
. . well . . . "
"You don't have to slug me with it," the man says. "But I never
heard of Bill or Jim."
"Oh, let him stay," the woman says.
Five minutes later there is a knock. The man opens the door.
"Hello," he says. "You wouldn't be Jim, by any chance?"
"Yes, I'm Jim. I'm looking for Polly. "
"Polly doesn't live here anymore. " The man sings it.
Jim sees me. "Hello, Bill," he says. He smiles and cancels all
the reproaches I had stored up.
"Let's go, Jim," I say, standing up. I tum to the man and woman.
"Thanks for your trouble. "

1 14

Wllll ll n'l S. Burrougha

"Anytime, old thing, " the man says. He is about to say something
more.
"That's okay, boys," the woman cuts in.
We walk out together. "I need a drink," Jim says. We find a
bar and sit down in a booth. There is no one else in the place.
Jim is beautiful but has the kind of face that shows every day that
much older. There are circles under his eyes, like bruises. He
drinks five double Scotches. He is sweet and gentle when drunk.
I help him out of the bar. We go to my room and sleep there.
Next morning I throw the few things I have--mostly photos and
manuscripts-into a plastic bag, and we leave.
Jim has a place on a roof. You unlock a metal door and climb
four flights of rusty, precarious stairs. One room with a mattress,
a table and a chair. Metal walls. A toilet in one comer, a gas stove
in another. A tap dripping into a sink.
Jim is trembling convulsively. "I'm scared, Bill," he says over
and over.
I hold him, and stroke his head, and undress him.
We sleep together until twelve that night. We wake up and dress
and Jim makes coffee. We take turns drinking from a tin can .
We start out looking for Polly. Jim gives me an extra key to his
place, before we leave the room.
The City is honeycombed with nightclubs and bars. Many of
them change locations every night. The nightclubs are under­
ground, hanging from cables, and built on perilous balconies a
thousand feet over the rubbish and rusty metal of the City.
We make the rounds, and we find Polly in Cliff's place. The
room shifts from time to time, with a creak of metal. It is built in
a rusty tower that sways in the wind. ''This place is too good to
last, kids," Cliff says, laughing.
Polly is a dark Jewish girl. She looks like that picture of Allen
Ginsberg on the beach when he was three years old. Jim is talking

there. She kisses me lightly on the lips and then on the ear,
murmuring, "Billy Boy . . . "
I find a car and ride down to the waterfront. I see a light. A
man is standing in a doorway.
"You open?" I ask.
"Why not?"
I go in. The place is empty. I sit at a table. He brings me a
soft drink without asking what I want, and sits down at the table
opposite me. A gentle, thuggish face, broken nose, battered but
calm and kind.
"Where you live at?" he asks me.
"No place now. "
"Want to shack up here?''
"Why not?" I finish my drink and he leads the way to a round
metal door that opens soundlessly on oiled bearings. He motions
for me to go in. His hand rests on my shoulder, and slides down
my ass with a gentle forward pat.

G INSBERG NOTES
Lee woke again. The room was light now. He could hear the clock
ticking, but he did not want to look at it, to locate himself definitely
in time, to be completely awake. He arranged the covers to shade
his eyes, pushing them away from his mouth so he could breathe
comfortably. A shiver ran through his body. He closed his eyes,
remembering his dream, clinging to sleep.
He had been dreaming about marshmallows. He had four or five
marshmallows, and he was preparing to toast them in little wooden
boxes which had wicks running around the edges like a kerosene
stove. The dream had a tone of furtive, but overpowering, sexuality.

What's sexy about marshmallows? he thought, irritably. He felt
aware of his sexual organs, but not in the normal manner of sexual
excitement. It was as if he could feel inside the whole genitourinary
apparatus, the intolerable, febrile sexuality of junk sickness.
Marshmallows, boxes . . . cunts, of course. Mary, the English
governess . . . dreams of something sticky in his mouth, like
chewing gum. The memory he never could reoccupy, even under
deep narcoanalysis. Whenever he got close to it, excitation tore
through him, suppressed below the level of emotional coloring, a
neutral energy like electricity. The memory itself never actually
seen or reexperienced, only delineated by refusals, disgusts, ne­
gation. He knew, of course, what it must be, but the knowledge
was of the brain only.
He shivered again, feeling the discordant twang of unfamiliar
visceral sensations, the light fever of sickness. The Spanish word

escalofrios came to him, then the English "chills and fever," hot
and cold. Every moment he felt more intolerably conscious. He
looked at the clock: eight-thirty. It was always slow-it was nearer
to nine.
Soon the drugstores will open . If only the methadone comes
through today . If only I could get my money so I can get to England
and take the cure .
If only his body had never known junk. How could he ever
unknow it? He decided he would settle for a cure and then a place
to live where it is never cold.
No use trying to sleep any longer. He pushed the covers aside
and sat up. Immediately he began to shiver. He crossed the room
and lit a small kerosene stove, with trembling hands. He reached
into an open drawer and took out a small syringe filled with color­
less liquid.
He held the syringe poised, and looked down at his blue hands,
coldly, impersonally. No use trying to hit there, he decided. He
felt along the side of his bare foot. There's one I might be able to

118

William S.

Burroughe

hit . He pushed the needle in his foot at the ankle, feeling, probing
for a vein. Pain swept through his sensitized flesh. A thin column
of blood climbed sluggishly into the syringe. He pressed the
plunger. The liquid went in very slowly. Every now and then his
foot twitched involuntarily away from the needle, which was embed­
ded almost to the point where it joined the syringe.
The last of the liquid drained in. He pulled out the needle and
stopped the blood with a piece of cotton. He sat listening down
into his viscera, waiting for the effect.

Lee had discovered that he got his best ideas while lying in bed
with a young boy after the fact. At first he thought this was co­
incidence. God damn it, every time I get ideas for writing, I am

occupied with a boy . Or maybe it's the other way around . . . hmm .
Weel, I'm in the right place .
He embarked on a three-thousand-page sexology, as he called
it. One after the other his boys were drained of their orgones and
cast aside, dragging themselves about like terminal hookworm­
malaria-malnutrition cases.
"I don't know why, but I just feel sorta tired after I make it with
that writing feller. "
"You can say that again, Pepe. And in all my experience man
and boy as a grade-A five-star hustler-A. ] . gives me five stars
in his Sex and Drug Guide-1 never yet see a citizen type and
get fucked at the same time. You shoulda seen me before I met
Lee. I was a good-looking kid, had all my hair and teeth. I'm
only twenty-four-well, twenty-nine. Shucks, we're in the same
line . . . . I can afford to let my hair down a bit, that is, if I had
any . . . . "

I figure it will require the orgones of ten thousand boys to finish
my sexology . I assume the frightful responsibility of the creative
artist .

A group of rich queens formed a corporation and offered a reward
of one million dollars to any assassin who would dispose of "this
shameless liquefactionist, who is debauching and decanting our
boys-oh, uh, I mean the youth of the world. "

!here are two middle-aged, ugly, fattish men in a club like the
University Club or the Harvard Club. The two are on cordial but
by no means familiar terms.
Scene is the club sitting-room. The other members are annoyed,
you understand, by anyone even talking there, as they want to sit
and think about their money and doze and digest. We will call
them Jack and Robert.
Jack: "Let's rekindle the embers!"
Robert: "Huh? The embers of precisely what?"
Jack: "Don't tell me you've forgotten our nights on the sandbanks
of the Putumayo with the piranha fish jumping out there in the soft
tropic darkness. All around us the brooding jungle of the Amazon,
like a great carnivorous plant. It was Auca country, but we were
drunk with youth and love. We laughed at danger and perhaps the
Auca laughed with us and lowered their poison arrows and stole
away into the jungle. And the moon so clear you could read by
it-why, I can see you now, lying there with your beautiful mouth
a little open, clad only in youth and innocence. "
Robert: "I'm damned i f you can! For one thing, I've never been
within a thousand miles of the Amazon!"
Jack: "And remember that waterfall back in the virgin jungle
of the upper Shipibo? We'd been walking all day since sun-up,
hacking our way through with machetes. And you said it was my
fault we'd missed the way, and sulked for ten hours. You always
looked beautiful when you were sulky. And then we broke through
the jungle to a crystal-clear river and a waterfall so high the top
was lost in mist, and we stripped off our clothes and played under

the waterfall until the sun went down and the mosquitoes came
out with the moon . "
Robert: "What are you talking about?"
Jack: "Let's go up to my room and play touchies !"
Robert: "Play what!"
Jack: "Touchies! Our little game!"
Robert: "Listen. I've had just about enough of your silly games,
and since you lead me to say so, Throckmorton, I strongly advise
you to see an able psychiatrist without delay . "
Jack: "Ah well, perhaps i t wasn't in the Amazon . . . come to
think of it. We were just kids, fourteen, fifteen. It was in a deserted
house down by the railroad tracks. We made a great thing of
breaking into the house, and you looked at me solemnly and said:
'Do you realize we're burglars?' And there was an old mattress on
the floor in a dark room with the shutters nailed down, and we
dragged the mattress into the middle of the room and wrestled on
it, and you won, as you always did, and I lay there looking up at
you and a train whistled in the distance and we took off our clothes
in the musty darkness. It was like the pure blue flame of a welder's
torch: sudden, hot, intense in both of us . . . . Later we walked
home at twilight along the tracks, a beautiful clear Indian summer
day, and we were so happy we didn't say anything all the way
home, with our arms around each other's necks, so young it never
occurred to either of us anyone would think anything about it. And
when we got back to the main road it was dark, with a full moon
rising red over the smokestacks of the city and the smell of burning
leaves in the air. . . . "
Robert: "You obviously have me confused with someone else.
Now if you will excuse me. "
Jack: "Wait a minute! It all comes back now . . . . I had a little
studio apartment on Jane Street in the Village. It was my first time
really away from home and on my own. I was young, I had a
secondhand Remington, I was going to write the Great American

INTERZON E

Novel. So what difference did it make if the bed was lumpy, and
the windowpane vibrated in a raw winter wind, and the radiator
gave off more noise than heat, and a black dust seeped into the
room and covered my manuscripts, my clothes, my pillow, and
got in my hair and ears so I always looked a little dirty? I was
happy, and deadly serious about my writing, and I believed in my
talcent.
"But I was desperately lonely. I had read Oscar Wilde and Gide
and Proust and Havelock Ellis. I knew that I was destined to love
my own sex as long as I lived. I accepted this. After all, so many
great writers had been like that. I used to go out after writing all
day, every night to a different bar, always hoping to meet someone
who would understand what I was trying to say on paper, who
would share my lumpy bed, and we would wake up in the cold,
gray dawn, warm with each other's bodies.
"Then one night I happened into a strange, equivocal place on
Twelfth Street at Second Avenue. It was called The Clock Bar.
The Clock had no regular crowd. It was not bohemian or tough or
Bowery. It was a place where anyone could happen in. The place
was empty-except for you . . . . "
Take it up from the next page. You can carry this second-rate­
novel kick too far. I just got writing and couldn't stop.

When a depressed psychotic begins to recover, that is, when
recovery becomes possible, the illness makes a final all-out attack ,
and this i s the point of maximum suicide danger. You might say
the human race is now at this point, in a position for the first time,
by virtue of knowledge which may destroy us, to step free of self­
imposed restrictions and see all life as a fact. When you see the
world direct, everything is a delight, and boredom or unhappiness
is impossible.
The forces of negation and death are now making their all-out

1 22

Wi l l iam S.

suicidal effort. The citizens of the world are helpless in a paranoid
panic. First one thing and then another is seen as the enemy, while
the real enemy hesitates-perhaps because it looks too easy, like
an ambush. Among the Arabs and the East in general, the West
(especially America), or domination by foreigners, is seen as the
enemy. In the West: communism, queers, drug addicts.
Queers have been worked over by female Senders. They are a
reminder of what the Senders can and will do unless they are
stopped. Also many of them have sold out their bodies to Death,
Inc. Their souls wouldn't buy a paper of milk sugar shit. But the
enemy needs bodies to get around.
Also there is no doubt some drugs condition one to receive, that
is, soften one up for the Senders. Junk is not such a drug, but it
is a prototype of invasion. That is, junk replaces the user cell by
cell until he is junk, so the Sender will invade and replace until
separate life is destroyed. Nothing but fact can save us, and Ein­
stein is the first prophet of fact. Anyone is free, of course, to
deliberately choose insanity and say that the universe is square or
heart-shaped, but it is, as a matter of fact, curved.
Similar facts: morality (at this point an unqualified evil), ethics,
philosophy, religion, can no longer maintain an existence separate
from facts of physiology, bodily chemistry, LSD, electronics, phys­
ics. Psychology no longer exists, since a science of mind has no
meaning. Sociology and all the so-called social sciences are suspect
to be purveyors of pretentious gibberish.
The next set of facts of similar import will most likely come from
present research on schizophrenia, the electronics of hallucination
and the metabolism of insanity, cancer, the behavior and nature
of viruses-and possibly drug addiction as a microcosm of life,
pleasure and human purpose. It is also from such research that
the greatest danger to the human race will come-probably has
already come-a danger greater than the atom bomb, because more
likely to be misunderstood.

I am taking another junk cure-is this my tenth or eleventh
cure? I forget-in the Hassan Hospital of Interzone. They are
curing me slow, and why not? Stateside croakers are mostly puritan
sadists, who feel a junky should suffer taking the cure. Here they
look at it differently.
I could never have been a doctor. I did right to quit. My heart
is too soft and too hard, too quickly moved to love, anger, or
indifference. I would care too much for some patients and nothing
for others: Like I mess a case up and kill some jerk, so I say: "It's
all in the day's work. Get this stiff outa here. I'm waiting on another
patient. "
People talk about "the hospital smell. " You never had it till you
sniff a Spanish hospital. All the old standbys: ether, carbolic,
alcohol, the antiseptic, ozone smell of bandages plus piss and shit
and dirty babies, cunts with the rag on, never-washed pricks, sweat
and garlic, saffron and olive oil, afterbirths, gangrene, keif and
death.
I used to be in room 10 and they moved me upstairs. Just passed
my old room , where they had a maternity case, looks like. Terrible
mess and bedpans full of blood and Kotex and nameless female
substances enough to pollute a continent. Just thought, suppose
somebody comes to visit me in my old room, they will think I give
birth to a monster, and the State Department is trying to hush
it up.
Dave Dunlop just came in, and I was telling him about the eels.
It was a Dane found out about them. Gave his whole life to the
eels-it would be a Dane, somehow. When the adult eels reach
the Sargasso Sea, which is actually a place in the Atlantic, they
go down into it and disappear. It is assumed they mate and die
down there-nobody has seen them doing either-but sure as shit
an eel doesn't come all that distance and lose his ass in the service
for no purpose.

Often pain and death leave me untouched. I have seen hundreds
of bullfights. I feel nothing for the bull. The old man who died a
few days ago just annoyed me with his groans. He had the stupid,
blunted look of a sick cow. Some people would call me callous,
but I am not so. It is simply that I divide people into those who
matter and those who do not, and I have no concern with quan­
titative criteria. If I do feel someone else's pain, I feel it with my
whole being. It shatters me. I just heard a child screaming down­
stairs, and tears came to my eyes. I can't stand the pain of children.
No, I could never have been a doctor. I would be crying over some
child while people I didn't like died in the hall.

More trouble with the Evil Night Nurse. I caught her inflagrante
cutting my shot in half with water. I don't say nothing. Later she
doesn't even bother to cut it. Just brings me a shot of two ampules,
instead of four like she's supposed.
I say: "That's two centimeters . "
She say: "No, it's four. The syringe is bigger. "
I say: "Look, senorita" (she's no more senorita than I am. Brazen
old junky cunt)-"1 got eyes. I want four centimeters . "
" I can't give you any more."
"All right, senorita . I'll be having a little talk with the croaker
-

manana . "
See what I mean? I give her a chance to come up right. If she
told me straight, "I got a habit. You know how it is," I would say,
"All right. All right. Just fuck up somebody else's shot. "
But she gives me a snow job. Well, I'm going to fix her wagon
good.

Yesterday I meant to add a few sentences to this. Possessed by
a wild routine and wrote two pages. I laughed till my stomach hurt.

I NTERZONE

These routines will reduce me to a cinder, like the Technician.
And how can I ever write a "novel"? I can't and won't. The "novel"
is a dead form, rigid and arbitrary. I can't use it.
The chapters form a mosaic, with the dream impact of juxta­
position, like objects abandoned in a hotel drawer, a form of still
life. Just looking over Chapter II. I don't know. The mosaic meth­
od is more suitable to painting than writing. I mean, you can see
a painting as a whole.
What I want to do in Chapter II is to indicate Lee's literal point
of view. The following concepts are central:
l.

He writes with horror and foreboding because his writing is

meant to be acted out somewhere, somehow, sometime, and so
can put him in actual danger.
2. Repetition of Lee's desire and intention to kick habit. Junk
keeps him in state of suspension. He must kick to realize his
routines. His cautious, junk-bound flesh is reluctant to leave the
safety of junk. I notice the songs that sing themselves in my head
indicate my hesitancy to leave the safe, warm place of junk. One
for example: I heard the tune a long time before I remembered the
words. It's about an old spade who has sold his "cabin and patch
of ground" to go north for better pay:
"But Dinah she don't want to go
She says we're getting old
She's 'fraid that she will freeze to death
The country am so cold
That story 'bout the work and pay
She don't believe it's true
She begs me not to do the thing
That I am bound to do. "

Dinah is junk, of course-that is, my cellular representative of
junk.

1 28

Wi l l i an� S.

3. His love for anyone is always a pretext, a means to achieve
something, to go somewhere. . . . Perhaps the search for an ideal
audience?
4. The Routine (Birth of the Monster, Hassan the Afterbirth
King, the Baboon Stick, etc . ) as Lee's special form. What distin­
guishes the routine from writing, painting, music? It is rwt com­

pletely symbolic but subject to slide over into action at any time.
(Cutting off finger joint, wrecking the car, etc. In a sense, the
whole Nazi movement was a great, humorless, evil routine on
Hitler's part . ) Routines are uncontrollable, unpredictable, charged
with potential danger for Lee himself, and anyone close to him is
liable to be caught in the line of fire. I mean the so-called innocent
bystanders. Actually there are no "innocent bystanders. " In the
immortal words of Huneke, "We are all guilty of everything. "
Of all forms , the routine is closest to bullfighting. The routine
artist is always trying to outdo himself, to go a little further, to
commit some incredible but appropriate excess. A routine, like a
bullfight, needs an audience. In fact the audience is an integral
part of the routine. But unlike a bullfight, the routine can endanger
the audience.

This morning the orderly took my table away to surgery. I opened
my knife and held it out to him: "Need this too?" I'm the life of
the hospital.
A wet dream of a thirteen-year-old redheaded kid waiting for
treatment, sitting on the long white waiting bench . . . I see myself
a doctor, bandaging his thigh with "sweet, reluctant, amorous
delay. "
"Mrs. Brounswig is in shock, Doctor. I can't find her pulse. "
"Maybe she's got it up her snatch in a finger stall. "
"Adrenalin, doctor?"
"The night porter shot it all up for kicks . "

Tangier extends in several dimensions. You keep finding places
you never saw before. There is no line between "real world" and
"world of myth and symbol. " Objects, sensations, hit with the
impact of hallucination. Of course I see now with the child's eyes,
the Lazarus eyes of return from the gray Limbo of junk. But what
I see is there. Others see it too.

I am selecting, editing and transcribing letters and notes from
the past year, some typed, some indecipherable longhand, for
Chapter II of my novel on Interzone, tentatively entitled Ignorant

Armies .
Find I cannot write without endless parenthesis (a parenthesis
indicates the simultaneity of past, present and emergent future).
I exist in the present moment. I can't and won't pretend I am dead.
This novel is not posthumous. A "novel" is something finished,
that is, dead1 am trying, like Klee, to create something that will have a life

ofits own, that can put me in real danger, a danger which I willingly
take on myself.
My thoughts turn to crime, incredible journeys of exploration,
expression in terms of an extreme act, some excess of feeling or
behavior that will shatter the human pattern.
Klee expresses a similar idea: "The painter who is called will
come near to the secret abyss where elemental law nourishes ev­
olution. " And Genet, in his Journal of a Thief "The creator has
committed himself to the fearful adventure of taking upon himself,
to the very end, the perils risked by his creatures. "
Genet says h e chose the life of a French thief for the sake
of depth . By the fact of this depth, which is his greatness, he
is more humanly involved than I am. He carries more excess

baggage. I only have one "creature" to be concerned with:
myself.

Four months ago I took a two-week sleep cure-a ghastly routine.
I had it almost made. Another five days sans junk would have seen
me in the clear. Then I relapsed. Just before relapse, I dreamed
the following:
I was in high mountains covered with snow. It was in a suicide
clinic: "You just wait till you feel like it. " I was on a ledge with
a boy, about sixteen years old-I could feel myself slipping further
and further out, out of my body, you dig. I don't mean a physical
slipping on the ledge. The Plane was coming for me. (Suicide is
performed by getting in this Plane with a boy. The Plane crashes
in the Pass. No Plane ever gets through. )
Marv reaches out and catches my arm and says: "Stay here with
us a while longer. "
The suicide clinic is in Turkey. Nothing compulsory. You can
leave anytime, even take your boy out with you. (Boat whistle in
the distance. A bearded dope fiend rushing to catch the boat for
the mainland . ) My boy says he won't leave with me unless I kick
my habit.
Earlier dream-fantasy: I am in a plane trying to make the Pass.
There is a boy with me, and I tum to him and say: "Throw every­
thing out."
"What! All the gold? All the guns? All the junk?"
"Everything."
I mean throw out all excess baggage: anxiety, desire for approval,
fear of authority, etc. Strip your psyche to the bare bones of spon­
taneous process, and you give yourself one chance in a thousand
to make the Pass.
I am subject to continual routines, which tear me apart like a

homeless curse. I feel myself drifting further and further out, over
a bleak dream landscape of snow-covered mountains.

This novel is a scenario for future action in the real world. Junk,

Queer, Yage, reconstructed my past. The present novel is an at­
te�pt to create my future. In a sense it is a guidebook, a map.
The first step in realizing this work is to leave junk forever.
I'll maintain this International Sophistico-criminal Mahatma
con no longer. It was more or less shoved on me anyway. So I
say: "Throw down all your arms and armor, walk straight to the
Frontier. "

A guard in a uniform of human skin, black buck jacket with
carious yellow tooth buttons, an elastic pullover shirt in burnished
Indian copper, adolescent Nordic suntan-brown slacks, sandals
from the calloused foot sole of a young Malay farmer, an ash-brown
scarf knotted and tucked in the shirt. He is a sharp dresser since
he has nothing to do, and saves all his pay, and buys fine clothes
and changes three times a day in front of an enormous magnifying
mirror. He has a handsome, smooth Latin face with a pencil-line
mustache, small brown eyes blank and greedy, eyes that never
dream, insect eyes.
When you get to the Frontier, this guard rushes out of his casita,
where he was plucking at his mustache, a mirror slung round his
neck in a wooden frame. He is trying to get the mirror off his neck.
This has never happened before, that anyone ever actually got to
the Frontier. The guard has injured his larynx taking off the mirror
frame. He has lost his voice. He opens his mouth and you can see
his tongue jumping around inside. The smooth, blank, young face
and the open mouth with the tongue moving inside are incredibly
hideous. The guard holds up his hand, his whole body jerking in

convulsive negation. I pay no attention to him. I go over and unhook
the chain across the road. It falls with a clank of metal on stone.
I walk through. The guard stands there in the mist, looking after
me. Then he hooks the chain up again and goes back inside the

casita and starts plucking at his mustache.

At times I feel myself on the point of learning something basic.
I have achieved moments of inner silence.

The blame for this atrociously incomplete act rest solidly on the
basement of Brubeck, my own innocence of any but the most pure
reflex move of self-defense and -respect to eliminate this strange
serpent thrust so into my face at risk of my Man Life, so I, not
being armed (unfortunately) with a blunderbuss, had recourse to
nature's little white soldiers-our brave defenders by land-and
bite his ugly old cock in a laudable attempt to circumcise him
thereby reduce to a sanitary condition. He, not understanding the
purity of my motives, did inopportunely resist my well-meaning
would-be surgical intervention, which occasioned to him light con­
tusions of a frivolous nature. Whereupon he did loose upon my
innocent head a blast of blasphemies like burning lions or unsuc­

"Let this be a lesson to you boys," said the old sheriff, eyes
pale and empty as blue sky over the neon midways of America.
Shattering bloody blue of Mexico, brains spilled in the cocktail
lounge, white leather and blue silk, and the fat macho substance

Heart in the sun, headless snake, hanged man's cock pulsing
on the holy gallows, pantless corpses hang from posts along the
road to Monterrey.
The boys whistle and wolf-call. One catches jissom in a straw
hat and passes it around in obscene, begging pantomime and each
boy jacks off into it. A boy twangs the rope and sings like an
angel, voice clear, hard, metallic as wind in high wires over a
gorge, waterfalls and rainbow.
"Watch those prehensile tensions!" screams the belching Tech­
nician . . . as the bridge wires snap, spill screaming hot rods into
the void.
"Play chicken with gravity, you little pricks!" snarls the Tech­
nician . "I told them the fucking bridge wasn't worth a-" He farts
loud and ugly.
The great black crab penetrated with air-pistol pellet oozes wa­
tery crankcase oil.
The rope rot through, the rustler falls white as Narcissus into
the black water, glides down. The boys lean over to watch the
descent of the god, dissolve in sunlight, see hairs sharp as fine
wire and teeth and freckles-their mourning selves. The sheriff is
muttering through his toothless mean old-woman mouth, "Now, I
want you fellows to wear trunks . . . . Decent women with telescopes
can see you. We've had complaints. "

lamprey at his side where Christ's blood flowed and the colostomy

Police bullet i n the alley, broken wings of Icarus and screams

his screaming lungs and his body squirms in the Black Massage.
They walk down Lindell and into the house surrounded by de­
serted factories and junkyards; weeds and vines and the sound of
insects. They undress slow in a mirror-lined room, fuck all the
way out and back across backyards, ash pits and bars, stickball
games, virginal lots (little green snakes under rusty iron), cats
copulate and boys jack off in packing crate.
The pusher dropped around to leave his card. "Like the song
say, 'I'll be around. ' " Looking for a vein with a tattoo needle, the
boy's chest is marked over the hard limestone bone with blue bites.
The wind shakes billowing brass like yellow silk.
Lick of junk sickness eats at your heels like a dream rat, gnaw
the shiny white tendons probing for a vein of iron.
Chorus of Midwest fairies sing "Glow Worm" with lighted wands

Masochist queen refuse to leave burning warehouse because her
hand-trucking lover won't carry him.
Empty waxen child faces, the teeth go first.
Over the hills to the lonesome pines of Idaho, where boy hearts
pulse on Christmas trees, and ski-jumpers whistle over our heads
like bullets in the crystal night . . .
The boy is pure sad, all hate faded like smoke in the dawn
wind, clear and calm sad forever.
Carnival of splintered pink peppermint. Black mustache and
child screams after his lost balloon like a frustrated cocksucker.
Tattooed sailor leaves the penny arcade with firm young ass.
"Oh, those Golden Slippers-" Copper-luster chamber pots,
brass spittoons, black smoke on the hip in the Chink laundry.
Ski run revisited by old queen, his friend killed there in 1928,
black and empty against the vacationing sky.
"You're nothing but a larval," sneered one subsidiary personality
to another. "I'm a decent entity at least, got some outlines to me. "

S o this is the Burroughs special, a dash and a soupgon, a pinch

privy of the world for a glorious burial. Young asses wiped all over
the world, white ass and black ass, yaller ass and copper ass, pink
ass and bronze ass.
Two gentlemen opponents square off on the country club lawn.
With a bestial snarl one throws up his knee with murderous force.
The other pivots deftly, jabbing for his opponent's eyes with forked
fingers. They roll in the grass, screaming like mandrills and clawing
at each other's eyes and genitals.
