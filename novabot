To this end we invented variety in many forms, variety that is of information content in a molecule, which, <i>enfin</i>, is always a permutation of the existing material.

This alters chemical formulae and physiological effects. Apomorphine has no sedative narcotic or addicting properties. It is a metabolic regulator that need not be continued when its work is done. I quote from <i>Anxiety and Its Treatment </i>by Doctor John Dent of London: `Apomorphine acts on the back brain stimulating the regulating centers in such a way as to normalize the metabolism.' It has been used in the treatment of alcoholics and drug addicts and normalizes metabolism in such a way as to remove the need for any narcotic substance. Apomorphine cuts drug lines from the brain.

Thinking on any other level simply did not interest him. He was by the way very cruel but not addicted to the practice of cruelty. He was cruel if the opportunity presented itself.

      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In this organization, Mr. Lee, we do not encourage togetherness, esprit de corps. We do not give our agents the impression of belonging. As you know most existing organizations stress such primitive reactions as unquestioning obedience. Their agents become addicted to orders. You will receive orders of course and in some cases you will be well-advised not to carry out the orders you receive... the members of all existing organizations are at some point your enemy. You will learn to know where this point is if you survive. You will receive your instructions in many ways. From books, street signs, films, in some cases from agents who purport to be and may actually be members of the organization. There is no certainty. Those who need certainty are of no interest to this organization. This is in point of fact a <i>non-organization </i>the aim of which is to immunize our agents against fear despair and death. We intend to break the birth-death cycle. As you know inoculation is the weapon of choice against virus and inoculation can only be effected through exposure ... exposure to the pleasures offered under enemy conditions: a computerized Garden of Delights: exposure to the pain posed as an alternative . . you remember the ovens I think . . exposure to despair: `The end is the beginning born knowing' the unforgivable sin of despair.

      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Lykin was the first to awake - He could not remember where he was - Slowly his blue eyes blurred with exhaustion registered glowing red rocks and metallic shrubs with silver leaves that surrounded the little pool where he lay -The ghastly night flooded back into his memory - Controls of their space craft had suddenly blanked out by the intervention of an invisible alien force like an icy draught through the cabin -Not only the mechanical controls had been put out of action but their nerve centers had been paralyzed - He and Bradly the Co-pilot had sat helpless in their pressure seats for two hours while the invading force guided their ship in a sickening spiral through the poisonous cloud belts of an unknown planet - Lykin and Bradly had blacked out when they landed -How had they gotten out of the ship? – He stood up and tripped over the sleeping form of his companion naked except for the skin-tight transparent space suit that clung to his muscular body -He decided to have a quick look at the terrain before waking Bradly .- He was at the bottom of a gully surrounded by red rocks of some translucent substance - He climbed out of the gully and found himself on a plateau - A fantastic landscape of multicolored rock carved like statues of molten blue lava interspaced with stalagmites of a pearly white intensity he had never experienced in his previous explorations - The sky was like a green ocean - There were four suns on the horizon around the plateau, each sun of a ... red, and one (much larger than the others) a brilliant silver - The air was of a tingling clarity that seemed to support his body so that movements were incredibly precise and easily performed - He turned and started back down the gully toward the pool - He felt a click in his brain like a crystal flare and heard a silver voice: \"Come stranger\" - Bradly was accustomed to telepathic phenomena but this voice was unusually clear and immediate - He climbed over a large rock and saw the pool - His friend was still asleep - Beside him sat an amphibious green fish boy shimmering with water from the pool - The creature pulsed with translucent green light that flooded through the flesh in eddies – The head was a pointed dome that sprang from a slender neck on either side of which protruded gills like sensitive spongy wings - The creature was covered by a membranous substance with a network of transparent veins - The body surface was in constant motion like slow water dripping down a statue - The face was almost flat but with lips and nose sharply and beautifully delineated and huge liquid eyes above the high ridged cheekbones the delicate structure of which shone through transparent skin - The being was sitting in a cross-legged position and from its thighs jutted small silver fins of ... sinuous legs ended in webbed flippers - Between the legs Lykin could see the genitals half aroused in curiosity as the fish boy stroked the head of his sleeping companion and touched the space suit with tentative jabs of its long green fingers - Lykin moved cautiously so as not to frighten the creature back into the pool - The fish boy turned and looked at him with a shy dreamy smile - An electric shiver ran up his spine and burst in crystal fish syllables: \"Approach stranger - Have no fear\" - The creature's mouth had not moved - Lykin moved forward with excitement tingling through his body and knelt beside the water boy who extended a dripping hand and lightly clasped his shoulder - A thrill ran through him from the contact - Underwater memory bubbles burst in his brain - He was in the alien medium, squirming in crystal rock pools and basking on edges of limestone fanned by giant ferns in the sound of dripping water - Swimming through ruined cities with the water creatures twisting in slow swirls of orgasm, shooting out explosions of colored bubbles to the surface, trailing blue streamers –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Ali woke in a strange bed to find the proprietor standing over him, \"Who the fuck are you and what are you doing in my apartment?\" Ali flashed back to the suburban cocktail party - music from the '20s - old women doing the Charleston -and the Irishman with iron-grey hair who looked like a con cop from vaudeville –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Easy way and a tough way to do things, kid - i can put you up for the night in this apartment - The owner is out of town and i dont <i>think</i> he'll be back before tomorrow night - \"</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Ali dressed hastily -Tucking his shirt he slipped out into the American suburb - The streets were empty and clean like after a heavy rain - At an intersection of cracked concrete boys turned slow circles on roller skates under a half-moon in the morning sky, swept by storms of color as the sun rose -Ali felt his steps lighter and lighter - He floated away on eddies of blue and green - He alighted in the clear atmosphere of a green land where every blade of grass shone as if framed in crystal -The gravity pull was light so his feet barely touched the ground as he ran along clear streams of water under dripping trees - came to a city of worn marble streets and copper domes - In the lobby of a luxury hotel page boys in elaborate uniforms assessed his financial status with experienced eyes – On the wall was a little sign:</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Ali walked out into the main square -fish smells and dead eyes in doorways - obscene gestures of proposition - In a dark side street off the square Ali found what looked like an old chemist's shop with jars of colored liquid in the window - A little black man, body bent by a fibrous tumor came forward to meet him with a chirp of interrogation - He was wearing double lens glasses that slid down on his nose -Ali drew out the plastic bag he carried with the flattened grey membrane inside - The shopkeeper took it in smooth black fingers and held it up to the light – He gave a little chirping call and his assistant came in from shadow recesses of the shop - It was some creature like a large grasshopper with a body that changed color as he walked past the jars - The eyes were crystal lens – His penis, which was held in upright position by a long silver cord extending into the abdomen, moved in flash erections to currents of color- He held the membrane in adzes and grafting tools that fitted into his fibrous finger stumps -As he looked his body pulsed a brilliant green - The shopkeeper nodded and brought out a jar about two feet high full of a heavy white fluid - The assistant opened the envelope with a little curved knife and dropped the membrane into the jar -As Ali watched the membrane stirred like a Japanese flower and blossomed into a tiny green newt with human head- The creature opened black liquid eyes for a few seconds then curled into foetal sleep and sank to the bottom of the jar - The shopkeeper covered the jar with a cloth and put it on a dark shelf - He smiled and drew a map on the counter -Starting from the shop a dotted line led to a system of canals, a pump, two penises in orgasm, closed eyes of sleep five times - Then the dotted line led back to the shop - He looked at Ali to be sure he understood - Ali nodded and walked on the dotted line - The marble streets ended in mud - He could see a system of canals with thatched huts and gardens and tanks tended by little black men with fibrous tumors and moles from which sprouted green hairs - They looked up from their work and flashed quick smiles -A heavy smell of compost heaps and rotten ponds filled the air - As he passed over a bridge a green newt boy surfaced in a canal smiled and masturbated quickly ejaculating an iridescent fluid that glinted in the clear light - He twisted with a mocking laugh and dove out of sight in the black water - Ali walked along the canal and found himself in a maze of pumps and locks and could not find how he got there or the way out - At bottom of this maze a man in green tattered uniform motioned him to come down pointing to an iron stairway that led out on a wooden ramp - The man stood waiting at the end of the ramp - Ali walked toward him smiling like a dog - \"i am a stranger here - i am sorry if - i do not know your laws\" - The guard was smiling too-a slow familiar smile like: \"Perhaps you don't go into the prison if\" -flashed back to customs shed in South America - Ali bent over a chair feeling quick pants of the young policeman on his naked back - The carbine leaning against one wall sharp and clear in the flash bulb of orgasm - \"So\" - he thought \"things are not different here\" –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The man led him to a shed - Inside was a pallet on the floor - Clothing hung from wooden pegs - In another room he could see levers and wheels obviously controlling the pumps and locks -The man flicked Ali's clothes - He undressed slowly dropping his pants with a wriggling motion as his cock flipped out and up - The man stood naked in green light that filtered into the shed from overhanging vines and fruit trees - He picked Ali up in his arms and kissed him – His breath had a vegetable smell slightly rotten like tropical fruit -He carried Ali to the pallet and shoved his knees up to his ears - From a shelf he took a little jar of what looked like frogs' eggs and gave off an odor of moldy proteins - He rubbed the eggs into Ali's ass -Ali could feel something coming alive in his rectum and wriggling down into his testicles - The man slid his cock in - Ali squirmed teeth bared wriggling feelers caressing his penis rubbing around nerves at the tip - The man caught his ejaculation in the jar - Tiny green frogs with sucker paws stirred in the sperm –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He stayed for five nights with the man sleeping on the pallet and eating meals of fruit from the garden and helping with the wheels and levers - At the end of five days the man gave him the jar of eggs and he went back to the shop and gave the eggs to the shopkeeper –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The shopkeeper smiled and took the other jar down from the shelf - The green newt boy, still curled in sleep, had grown until it filled the jar -The shopkeeper drew a map on the counter dotted line to a but in the canal system-And Ali walked out carrying the jar along the line to a but where an old man greeted him – Ali uncovered the jar -The man clapped his hands softly and made a little clucking noise - He showed Ali a series of tanks behind his hut like an elaborate cesspool, one tank draining into another - In the tanks were green newt boys in various stages and the last tank opened out into black water of the canal - The man emptied the jar into the first tank – Ali turned to walk away and felt the man's hand on his shoulder, led him back into the hut - He measured Ali's neck like a tailor and selected from a shelf two dried gills which he fitted carefully and gave to Ali in a plastic envelope - He motioned to the sky - He made a choking sound and pointed to the bag-</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Ali began hustling around the square where the nobles cruised in the evening-dark street life of a place forgotten - The city was swept by waves of giant carnivorous land crabs and Ali learned to hide himself when he heard their snapping claws like radio static - Explosions of time film was another danger in the city - One evening in the square he heard a rumble like muffled thunder - Everyone running for the canals and shouting \"The Studio went up\" - A cloud of red nitrous fumes settled on the city - Ali, gasping and choking, remembered and reached for his plastic bag - He put the gills around his neck and dove into a wellhead carved to resemble a stone rectum - As he fell deep into the green water he could feel the gills cut into his neck - A sudden sharp taste of blood and he was breathing and swimming along an underground passage - He could see light ahead and came out into one of the open canals –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Ali woke in a strange bed - As you listen fill in with him \"Who the fuck are you and what are you doing in my image track?\" Ali was wide awake now and clicked \"out of here,\" female impersonators, music back to the '20s, suburban pool halls and vaudeville voice of a grey- haired Irishman who turned over a steady stream of \"easy way and a tough way to do time\" -Meanwhile i had forgotten the owner in this apartment - scent of memory pictures - people gone - back tomorrow night –</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Ali dressed hastily and slipped out - Board members, look, the streets are empty - Young faces melted the law, turned slow circles on roller skates - Nova Police look at the wired color sunrise - Errand boy floating on eddies of red and green alighted in slow-motion flashes of clear atmosphere - The gravity pull was lighter - does not know the frequency of junk - marble streets and copper domes - Darkened eyes of page boys in elaborate physical skin put his financial status out in the streets - East St. Louis music on chirping call -His genitals were voices out into other dressing rooms - long silver thread that extended in flash erections back and forth - switch to office of a garage - sharp desire held the membrane –</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The man was smiling, flapping vapor like rusty swamp smell -flicker back to a custom shed in South America - (\"First we must write the ticket\") - Feeling the quick pants of mummy - goosed his ass - carbine leaning against one wall - burning orgasm - wind voices beside masturbating pallet on the floor –</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Ali hanged after being milked, see?\" made a choking noise and pointed - orgasm of a place forgotten - Corpses hang from gallows - \"Land crabs\" - He dissolved in smoke and crumpled cloth –</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The \"Other Half\" is the word. The \"Other Half\" is an organism. Word is an organism. The presence of the \"Other Half\" a separate organism attached to your nervous system on an air of words can now be demonstrated experimentally. One of the most common \"hallucinations\" of subjects during sense withdrawal is the feeling of another body sprawled through the subject's body at an angle...yes quite an angle it is the \"Other Half\" worked quite some years on a symbiotic basis. From symbiosis to parasitism is a short step. The word is now a virus. The flu virus may once have been a healthy lung cell. It is now a parasitic organism that invades and damages the lungs. The word may once have been a healthy neural cell. It is now a parasitic organism that invades and damages the central nervous system. Modern man has lost the option of silence. Try halting your sub-vocal speech. Try to achieve even ten seconds of inner silence. You will encounter a resisting organism that <i>forces you to talk</i>. That organism is the word. In the beginning was the word. In the beginning of what exactly? The earliest artifacts date back about ten thousand years give a little take a little and \"recorded\" - (or prerecorded) history about seven thousand years. The human race is said to have been on set for 500,000 years. That leaves 490,000 years unaccounted for. Modern man has advanced from the stone ax to nuclear weapons in ten thousand years. This may well have happened before. Mr. Brion Gysin suggests that a nuclear disaster in what is now the Gobi desert wiped out all traces of civilization that made such a disaster possible. Perhaps their nuclear weapons did not operate on the same principle as the ones we have now. Perhaps they had no contact with the word organism. Perhaps the word itself is recent about ten thousand years old. What we call history is the history of the word. In the beginning of <i>that</i> history was the word.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The realization that something as familiar to you as the movements of your intestines the sound of your breathing the beating of your heart is also alien and hostile does make one feel a bit insecure at first. Remember that you can separate yourself from the \"Other Half\" from the word. The word is spliced in with the sound of your intestines and breathing with the beating of your heart. The first step is to record the sounds of your body and start splicing them in yourself. Splice in your body sounds with the body sounds of your best friend and see how familiar he gets. Splice your body sounds in with air hammers. Blast jolt vibrate the \"Other Half\" right out into the street. Splice your body sounds in with anybody or anything.

Bulletin 2323 is quite explicit on this point. Still he was unable to expunge a residual distaste for protoplasmic life deriving no doubt from his mineral origins. His mission was educational...the natives were to be scanned out of patterns laid down by the infamous 5th Colonists. Soon after his arrival he decided that he was confronting not only an outrageous case of colonial mismanagement but attempted nova as well. Reluctantly he called in the Nova Police. The Mission still functioned in a state of siege. Armed with nuclear weapons the 5th Colonists were determined to resist alterations. It had been necessary to issue weapons to his personnel. There were of course incidents...casualties...A young clerk in the Cultural Department declared himself the Angel of Death and had to be removed to a rest home. The D.S. was contemplating the risky expedient of a \"miracle\" that doesn't come off. He had of course put in an application to the Home Office underlining the urgency of his case contingent on the lengths to which the desperate 5th Colonists might reasonably be expected to go. Higher command has been vague and distant. He had no definite assurance that the necessary equipment would arrive on time. Would he have 3D in time?) – The human organism is literally consisting of two halves from the beginning word and all human sex is this unsanitary arrangement whereby two entities attempt to occupy the same three-dimensional coordinate points giving rise to the sordid latrine brawls which have characterized a planet based on 'the Word,' that is, on separate flesh engaged in endless sexual conflict - The Venusian Boy-Girls under Johnny Yen took over the Other Half, imposing a sexual blockade on the planet - (It will be readily understandable that a program of systematic frustration was necessary in order to sell this crock of sewage as Immortality, the Garden of Delights, and <i>love</i> –</span></p>\n",

Lee of the nova police - \"I doubt if any of you on this copy planet have ever seen a nova criminal - (they take considerable pains to mask their operations) and i am sure none of you have ever seen a nova police officer -When disorder on any planet reaches a certain point the regulating instance scans <i>police</i> - otherwise - Sput - Another planet bites the cosmic dust - i will now explain something of the mechanisms and techniques of nova which are always deliberately manipulated - i am quite well aware that no one on any planet likes to see a police officer so let me emphasize in passing that the nova police have no intention of remaining after their work is done - That is, when the danger of nova is removed from this planet we will move on to other assignments - We do our work and go –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\"The basic nova technique is very simple: Always create as many insoluble conflicts as possible and always aggravate existing conflicts-This is done by dumping on the same planet life forms with incompatible conditions of existence-There is of course nothing \"wrong\" about any given life form since \"wrong\" only has reference to conflicts with other life forms-The point is these life forms should not be on the same planet-Their conditions of life are basically incompatible in present time form and it is precisely the work of the nova mob to see that they remain in present time form, to create and aggravate the conflicts that lead to the explosion of a planet, that is to nova - At any given time recorders fix the nature of absolute need and dictate the use of total weapons - Like this: Take two opposed pressure groups - Record the most violent and threatening statements of group one with regard to group two and play back to group two - Record the answer and take it back to group one -back and forth between opposed pressure groups - This process is known as `feedback' - You can see it operating in any bar room quarrel - In any quarrel for that matter - Manipulated on a global scale feeds back nuclear war and nova -These conflicts are deliberately created and aggravated by nova criminals - The Nova Mob: 'Sammy the Butcher,' `Green Tony,' `the Brown Artist,' 'Jacky Blue Note,' `Limestone John,' `Izzy the Push,' `Hamburger Mary,' `Paddy The Sting,' `the Subliminal Kid,' `the Blue Dinosaur,' 'Willy the Rat' (who informed on his associates) and Mr and Mrs D also known as `Mr Bradly Mr Martin' also known as `the Ugly Spirit,' thought to be the leader of the mob - the nova mob - In all my experience as a police officer i have never seen such total fear and degradation on any planet - We intend to arrest these criminals and turn them over to the Biological Department for the indicated alterations –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Now you may well ask whether we can straighten out this mess to the satisfaction of any life forms involved and my answer is this -Your earth case must be processed by the Biological Courts - (admittedly in a deplorable condition at this time) -No sooner set up than immediately corrupted so that they convene every day in a different location like floating dice games, constantly swept away by stampeding forms all idiotically glorifying their stupid ways of life - most of them quite unworkable of course) - attempting to seduce the judges into Venusian sex practices, drug the court officials, and intimidate the entire audience chamber with the threat of nova – In all my experience as a police officer I have never seen such total fear of the indicated alterations on any planet - a thankless job you see and we only do it so it won't have to be done some place else under even more difficult circumstances –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\"The success of the nova mob depended on a blockade of the planet that allowed them to operate with impunity - This blockade was broken by partisan activity directed from the planet Saturn that cut the control lines of word and image laid down by the nova mob -So we moved in our agents and started to work keeping always in close touch with partisans - The selection of local personnel posed a most difficult problem - Frankly we found that most existing police agencies were hopelessly corrupt - The nova mob had seen to that - Paradoxically some of our best agents were recruited from the ranks of those who are called criminals on this planet - In many instances we had to use agents inexperienced in police work - These were of course casualties and fuck-ups - You must understand that an undercover agent witnesses the most execrable cruelties while he waits helpless to intervene, sometimes for many years, before he can make a definitive arrest - So it is no wonder that green officers occasionally slip control when they finally do move in for the arrest - This condition, known as `arrest fever,' can upset an entire operation - In one recent case, our man in Tangier suffered an attack of `arrest fever' and detained everyone on his view screen including some of our undercover men - He was transferred to paper work in another area - Let me explain <i>how</i> we make an arrest - nova criminals are not three-dimensional organisms - (though they are quite definite organisms as we shall see ) - but they need three-dimensional human agents to operate - The point at which the criminal controller intersects a three-dimensional human agent is known as `a coordinate point' - And if there is one thing that carries over from one human host to another and established identity of the controller it is<i> habit</i>: idiosyncracies, vices, food preferences - (we were able to trace Hamburger Mary through her fondness for peanut butter) - a gesture , a special look, that is to say the <i>style</i> of the controller - A chain smoker will always operate through chain smokers, an addict through addicts - Now a single controller can operate through thousands of human agents, but he must have a line of coordinate points - Some move on junk lines through addicts of the earth, others move on lines of certain sexual practices and so forth -It is only when we can block the controller out of all coordinate points available to him and flush him out from host cover that we can make a definitive arrest - Otherwise the criminal escapes to other coordinate\" –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Question</i>: \"Inspector Lee, i don't quite understand what is meant by a `coordinate point'- Could you make that a little clearer? -\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Answer</i>: \"Certainly - You see these criminal controllers occupy human bodies - ghosts? phantoms? Not at all - very definite organisms indeed - True you can't see them - Can you see a virus? - Well, the criminal controllers operate in very much the same manner as a virus -Now a virus in order to invade, damage and occupy the human organism must have a gimmick to get in -Once in the virus invades damages and occupies a certain area or organ in the body -known as the tissue of predilection - Hepatitis, for example, attacks the liver - Influenza the respiratory tract - Polio and rabies the central nervous system - In the same way a controller invades, damages and occupies some pattern or configuration of the human organism\" –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Question</i>: \"How do these controllers gain access to the human organism?\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Answer</i>: \"I will give an example: the controllers who operate through addiction to opiates - that is who occupy and control addicts of the earth -Their point of entry is of course the drug itself – And they maintain this coordinate point through addiction\" –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Question</i>: \"What determines the choice of coordinate points? Why does one controller operate through addiction in preference to other channels?\" –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Answer</i>: \"He operates through addicts because he himself is an addict - A heavy metal addict from Uranus - What we call opium or junk is a very much diluted form of heavy metal addiction - Venusians usually operate through sexual practices - In short these controllers brought their vices and diseases from their planet of origin and infected the human hosts very much in the same way that the early colonizers infected so-called primitive populations\" –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Question</i>: \"Inspector Lee, how can one be sure that someone purporting to be a nova police officer is not an impostor?\" –</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Answer</i>: \"It is not always easy, especially during this transitional period. There are imposters, `shake men,' who haunt atomic installations and victimize atomic scientists in much the same way as spurious police officers extort money from sexual deviants in public lavatories - In one recent case a well-organized shake mob, purporting to represent the nova police, confiscated cyclotrons and other atomic equipment which they subsequently sold on the Uranian black market to support their heavy metal habits - They were arrested and sent away for the thousand year cure - Since then we have encountered a few sporadic cases - cranks, lunatics for the most part\" –</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Just a technical sergeant is all - Just Time - Just Time - Just Time - \" So he moved in with the Rewrite Department and set up his headquarters to put out the Rewrite Bulletins on subliminal level - It's all done with tape recorders. Go out and buy three fine machines on credit and put your name down for an in-television unit. Find a boy with blue eyes and gentle precise fingers . . (He was a ham radio operator at twelve at the age of eight he released weather balloons which he fabricated from plastic suit covers . .) The boy will wire your machines for you. You need a switchboard so you can control the machines: Tape Recorder 1 playback five seconds Tape Recorder 2 and 3 record and so forth. Take an everyday situation you are arguing with your boy friend or girl friend remembering what was said last time and thinking of things to say, next time the whole stupid argument going going round and round like the music in your head until it bores you just silly to hear it but you are aggrieved and playing back self-pity and you just can't shut up. Take your arguments and complaints and put them on T.R.1 and call that machine Tom or Dick or Harry you name it it's yours. On T.R.2 put all the things he or she said to you or might say. Now make the two machines talk: T.R.1 playback five seconds T.R.2 record. T.R.2 playback three seconds T.R.1 record. Run it through fifteen minutes half an hour now switch intervals. Run the interval switch you used on T.R.1 back on T.R.2. - (You will find that the intervals are as important as the so-called context) - listen to the two machines mixing it around and around. Now for T.R.3 - (Who is the third that walks beside you?) - With T.R.3 you can introduce the factor of \"irrelevant response\" so put just any old thing on T.R.3 a sad old tune a sad old joke a piece of the street TV radio and cut T.R.3 into the argument T.R.1: \"I waited up for you last night till two o'clock\" . . T.R.3: \"And now if you will excuse me . . The soccer scores are coming in from the capitol . . One must pretend an interest . .\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Get it out of your head and into the machines. Stop talking stop arguing. Let the machines talk and argue. A tape recorder is an externalized section of the human nervous system. You can find out more about the nervous system and gain more control over your reaction by using a tape recorder than you could find out sitting twenty years in the lotus posture. Whatever your problem is just throw it into the machines and let them chew it around a while. There is of course the initial problem: programming tape recorders is an expensive deal any way you wire it.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The spliced-tape experiment to which I have already referred can be performed by anyone equipped with two tape recorders connected by extension lead so he can record directly from one machine to the other. Since the experiment may give rise to a marked erotic reaction it is more interesting to select as your partner for this experiment some one with whom you are on intimate terms. We have two subjects designated as S and W. Now take a text any text. S records the text on Tape Recorder 1. W records the same text on Tape Recorder 2. Now play back T.R.1 three seconds recording on T.R.2. Play back T.R.2 three seconds recording on T.R.1 and so forth <i>alternating</i> the two recorded voices. This is the simplest form of the spliced-tape experiment. The same results can be obtained by splicing two street recordings made separately by S and W. In order to obtain any degree of precision the tapes must be cut with a scissors and spliced together with tape. This is a laborious process that can be appreciably expedited if you have access to a cutting room and use film tape which is larger and much easier to handle. You can carry the experiment further by taking a talking film of S and a talking film of W and splicing sound and image track alternating 24 times per second.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">S and W carry in their respective and presumed separate nervous systems the equipment to record and playback sound to take images, equipment of which recorder and camera are the externalized abstraction. The equipment contained in the nervous systems of our two subjects is capable of <i>total recording</i> that is of recording and storing sound image smell tactile sensations and the affective reactions associated with this material. The total recording is activated by the playback of sound and image track by precise association with it, so that when we cut the film and sound record made on recorder and camera by our two subjects in together we are splicing the total record of S in with the total record of W. A flu virus is able to take over a healthy lung cell by giving the same signals as a healthy lung cell. The virus can give the same signals as a healthy lung cell because <i>it was a healthy lung cell at one time</i>. Spliced tape and film may or may not give rise to virus forms - (<i>Warning: experiments with spliced tape and film are dangerous</i> parenthetically) - In any case a unit of sound track recorded and film taken by S spliced in with W is now able to give the same signals as a W unit because it <i>was that unit by the fact of being recorded on W's sound and image track</i> and replacing the sound and image unit recorded and filmed by W. We may say that S can give the same signals as AV <i>because he retroactively was</i> W when an S unit of sound and image is cut into W's sound and image track replacing W with S. Of course the same replacements are occurring in the sound and image track of S. <i>If S is spliced into the total record o f W and W is not spliced into the total record of S this unilateral splicing may result in W contracting an S virus to his considerable disadvantage.</i></span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Many applications of the spliced-tape principle will suggest themselves to the alert reader. Suppose you are some creep in a grey flannel suit. You want to present a new concept of advertising to the Old Man . . <i>creative advertising </i>: \"I mean advertisements that tell a story and create characters Inspector J. Lee of the Nova Police smokes Players - (flashes his dirty rotten hunka tin) . Agent K 9 uses a Bradly laser gun. Aurelius would have approved your favorite smoke. Advertisements should provide the same entertainment value as the content of a magazine. Call in the best writers to write the continuity the best painters and photographers on the layout. <i>Your </i>product<i> deserves</i> the best.\" So before he goes up against the Old Man he records the Old Man's voice and splices his own voice in explaining his new concept and puts it out on the office air-conditioning system. Or suppose you are a singer. Well splice your singing in with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Animals. Splice yourself in with newscasters, prime ministers, presidents. Why stop there? Why stop anywhere? Everybody splice himself in with everybody else. Communication must be made total. only way to stop it.</span></p>\n",

God's little toy Paul Bowles calls it . . (Maybe his last toy parenthetically he is gone away through unknown mornings leave a million tape recordings of his voice behind fading into the cold spring air pose a colorless question?) . . Why not give Carry Corder parties? Every guest arrives with his Carry Corder and cartridges of what he intends to say recording what other Carry Corders say to him it is the height of rudeness not to record when directly addressed by another Carry Corder no one can talk <i>directly</i> at a Carry Corder party if you want to say something you have to nick off into the little boy's room and record it first while your genial host mixes the whole party around on a battery of tape recorders . . (\"Not infrequently I stripped to the waist and pitched in with the men . . Yes boys that's me there by the cement mixer.\") . . You can use the recordings from the last party at the next party funeral meats serving up the wedding feast in the word of the Immortal Bard tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow . .

Exactly what i intend to do - Turn all my tapes over to Rewrite and go home - You can look any place - No good - <i>No bueno</i> - Departed have left no address - It's all done with tape recorders. What we see is dictated by what we hear. You can verify this by a simple experiment. Turn off the sound track on your television set and use an arbitrary recorded sound track from your tape recorder: street sounds . . music . . conversation. . recordings of other TV programs, radio et cetera.You will find that the arbitrary sound track seems to be appropriate . . people running for a bus in Piccadilly with a sound track of machine-gun fire looks like 1917 Petrograd. You can extend the experiment by using material that is more or less appropriate to the image track. For example take a political speech on TV shut off sound track and substitute another speech you have prerecorded . . hardly tell the difference . . isn't much . . Record the sound track of one Danger Man spy program and substitute for another . . Try it on your friends and see if they can't tell the difference.</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I was working the hole with the sailor and we did not do bad. Fifteen cents on an average night boosting the afternoons and short-timing the dawn we made out from the land of the free. But I was running out of veins. I went over to the counter for another cup of coffee. . .in Joe's Lunch Room drinking coffee with a napkin under the cup which is said to be the mark of someone who does a lot of sitting in cafeterias and lunchrooms. . . Waiting on the man. . . \"What can we do?\" Nick said to me once in his dead junky whisper. \"They know we'll wait. . .\" Yes, they know we'll wait. . . There is a boy sitting at the counter thin-faced kid his eyes all pupil. I see he is hooked and sick. Familiar face maybe from the pool hall where I scored for tea sometime. Somewhere in grey strata of subways all-night cafeterias rooming house flesh. His eyes flickered the question. I nodded toward my booth. He carried his coffee over and sat down opposite me.</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You wouldn't believe how hot things were when I left the States—I knew this one pusher wouldn't carry any shit on his person just shoot it in the line—Ten twenty grains over and above his own absorption according to the route he was servicing and piss it out in bottles for his customers so if the heat came up on them they cop out as degenerates—So Doc Benway assessed the situation and came up with this brain child—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Once in the Upper Baboonasshole I was stung by a scorpion—the sensation is not dissimilar to a fix— Hummm.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">So he imports this special breed of scorpions and feeds them on metal meal and the scorpions turned a phosphorescent blue color and sort of hummed. \"Now we must find a worthy vessel,\" he said—So we flush out this old goof ball artist and put the scorpion to him and he turned sort of blue and you could see he was fixed right to metal—These scorpions could travel on a radar beam and service the clients after Doc copped for the bread—It was a good thing while it lasted and the heat couldn't touch us—However all these scorpion junkies began to glow in the dark and if they didn't score on the hour metamorphosed into scorpions straight away—So there was a spot of bother and we had to move on disguised as young junkies on the way to Lexington—Bill and Johnny we sorted out the names but they keep changing like one day I would wake up as Bill the next day as Johnny—So there we are in the train compartment shivering junk sick our eyes watering and burning.</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">And all of a sudden the sex chucks hit me in the crotch and I sagged against the wall and looked at Johnny too weak to say anything, it wasn't necessary, he was there too and without a word he dipped some soap in warm water and dropped my shorts and rubbed the soap on my ass and worked his cock up me with a corkscrew motion and we both came right away standing there and swaying with the train clickety clack clack spurt spurt into the brass cuspidor—We never got to Lexington actually—Stopped off in the town of Marshal and hit this old country croaker for tincture with the aged mother suffering from piles in the worst form there is line and he wrote like a major—That night we got into a pool game and Doc won a Dusenberg Panama hat tan suit and dark glasses like 1920 sports and the further South we went the easier it was to score like we brought the twenties along with us—Well we come to this Mexican border town in time to see something interesting—In order to make way for a new bridge that never got built actually they had torn down a block of shacks along the river where the Chink railway workers used to smoke the black stuff and the rats had been down under the shacks hooked for generations—So the rats was running all through the street squealing sick biting everyone in sight—When we went to look for our car couldn't find it and no cars anywhere just this train left over from an old Western—The track gave out somewhere north of Monterrey and we bought some horses off a Chinaman for a tin of mud—By this time there were soldiers everywhere shooting the civilians so we scored for some Civil War uniforms and joined one of the warring powers—And captured five soldiers who were wearing uniforms of a different color and the General got drunk and decided to hang the prisoners just for jolly and we rigged up a cart with a drop under a tree limb—The first one dropped straight and clean and one of the soldiers wiped his mouth and stepped forward grinning and pulled his pants down to an ankle and his cock flipped out spurting—We all stood there watching and feeling it right down to our toes and the others who were waiting to be hanged felt it too—So we stripped them and they got hard-ons waiting—They couldn't help it you understand. That night we requisitioned a ranch house and all got drunk and Johnny did this dance with his tie around his neck lolling his head on one side and letting his tongue fall out and wriggled his ass and dropped his pants and his cock flipped out and the soldiers rolled around laughing till they pissed all over themselves—Then they rigged up a harness under his arms and hoisted him up off the floor to a beam and gang-fucked him—By the time we got to Monterrey there was Spaniards around in armor like a costume movie and again we were lucky to arrive just at the right time. There was a crowd of people in the Zoco and we pushed up front with our rush-hour technique and saw they were getting ready to burn some character at the stake—When they lit the faggots at his feet the only sound you could hear was the fire crackling and then everyone sucked in his breath together and the screams tore through me and my lips and tongue swole up with blood and I come in my pants—And I could see others had shot their load too and you could smell it like a compost heap, some of us so close our pants steamed in the fire just pulling the screams and the smoke down into our lungs and sort of whimpering—It was tasty I tell you—So we hit Mexico City just before sunrise and I said here we go again—That heart pulsing in the sun and my cock pulsed right with it and jissom seeped through my thin cotton trousers and fell in the dust and shit of the street—And a boy next to me grinning and gave me a backhand pickpocket feel, my cock still hard and aching like after a wet dream—And we crawled up onto a muddy shelf by the canal and made it there three times slow fuck on knees in the stink of sewage looking at the black water—It turned out later this kid had the Epilepsy—When he got these fits he would flop around and come maybe five times in his dry goods, made you feel good all over to watch it—He really had it built in and he told me he could fix it with a magic man we trade places—So we started off on foot across the mountains and down the other side to high jungle warm and steamy and he kept having these fits and I dug it special fucking him in the spasm his asshole fluttering like a vibrator-—Well we come to this village and found the magic man in a little hut on the outskirts—An evil old character with sugary eyes that stuck to you—We told him what we wanted and he nodded and looked at both of us and smiled and said he would have to cook up the medicine we should come back next day at sundown—So we came back and he gave us the bitter medicine in clay pots—And I hadn't put the pot down before the pictures started coming in sharp and clear: the hanged boy pulling his legs up to the chin and pumping out the spurts by the irrigation ditch, the soldiers swinging me around in the harness, the burned man screaming away like a good one and that heart just pulsing and throwing off spurts of blood in the rising sun—Xolotl was explaining to me that only one body is left in the switch they were going to hang me and when I shot my load and died I would pass into his body—I was paralyzed by the medicine any case and they stripped me and lashed my body with special type sex nettles that burned and stung all over and my tongue swole up and gagged me and my eyes blurred over with blood—They rigged up a gallows with a split-bamboo platform and a ladder and I start up the ladder Xolotl goosing me and stood under the noose and he tightens it around my neck muttering spells and then gets down on the floor leaving me alone up there on the platform with the noose waiting—I saw him reach up with an obsidian knife and cut the rope held the platform and I fell and silver light popped in my eyes like a flash bulb—I got a whiff of ozone and penny arcades and then I felt it start way down in my toes these bone wrenching spasms emptied me and everything spilled out shit running down the back of my thighs and no control in my body paralyzed, twisting up in these spasms the jissom just siphoned me right into Xolotl's cock and next thing I was in his ass and balls flopping around spurting all over the floor and that evil old fuck crooning and running his hands over me so nasty— But then who am I to be critical?—I stayed there in the magic man's hut for three days sleeping and woke up the lookout different—And the magic man gave me some medicine to control the fits and I headed on south —Came at sundown to a clear river where boys were swimming naked—And one of them turned grinning with a hard-on and shoved his finger in and out his fist and I fell in one of my fits so they all had a go at me —The cold mountain shadows came down and touched my naked ass and I went back with the boy to his hut and ate beans and chili and lay with him on the floor breathing the pepper smell of his belches and stayed there with him and worked his patch of corn on the side of the mountain—That boy could keep a hard-on all night and I used to stick peppers up my ass when he fucked me like my guts was on fire—Well maybe I would be there still, work all day and after the work knocked out no words no thoughts just sit there looking at the blue mountains and ate and belched and fucked and slept same thing day after day the greatest—But one day we scored for a bottle of mescal and got lushed and he looked at me and said: \"<i>Chinga de puto</i> I will rid the earth of you in the name of Jesus Christu!\" and charges me with a machete—Well I'd seen it coming and tossed a cup of mescal in his eyes and side-stepped and he fell on his face and I rammed the planting stick right into the base of his brain—So that was that—And started South again and came finally to this spot where a lot of citizens were planting corn with sticks all working in concert, I didn't like the look of it but I was strung out for groceries and decided to make contact a mistake as it turned out—Because as soon as I walked out into that field I felt this terrible weight on me and there I was planting corn with them and everything I did and thought was already done and thought and there was this round of festivals where the priests put on lobster suits and danced around snapping their claws like castanets and nothing but maize maize maize— And I guess I would be there yet fructifying the maize God except for this one cat who was in Maya drag like me but I could see he was a foreigner too—He was very technical and a lovely fellow—He began drawing formulas on the floor and showed me how the priests operated their control racket: \"It's like with the festivals and the fucking corn they know what everybody will see and hear and smell and taste and that's what thought is and these thought units are represented by symbols in their books and they rotate the symbols around and around on the calender.\" And as I looked at his formulas something began to crack up in my brain and I was free of the control beam and next thing we both got busted and sentenced to \"Death in Centipede\" —So they strapped us to couches in a room under the temple and there was a terrible smell in the place full of old bones and a centipede about ten feet long comes nuzzling out of one corner—So I turn on something I inherit from Uranus where my grandfather invented the adding machine-—I just lay there without any thought in tons focus of heavy blue silence and a slow wave went through me and spread out of me and the couch began shaking and the tremors spread into the ground and the roof fell in and crushed the centipede and smashed the couch so the straps were loose and 1 slipped out and untied Technical Tilly—So we got out of there dodging stellae and limestone skulls as the whole temple came down in chunks and the wind blowing a hurricane brought in a tidal wave and there wasn't much left of the whole set when things cleared away—All the workers were running around loose now looking for the priests—The head priest was paralyzed and had turned into a centipede—We found him in a cubby hole under the rubble along with some others who were half crab or in various stages of disgusting metamorphosis—And I figured we should do something special with these characters they are wise guys—So we organize this \"fun fest\" and made some obsidian jockstraps strung together with copper wire and heated the straps up white-hot and slipped them on, the priests did a belly dance like you used to see it in burlesque and we sat there yelling; \"Take it off Take it off,\" laughing till we pissed and shit and came—You never heard such laughing with the control gone and goosing them with hot copper pricks—And others we put weights on their backs and dragged them through wooden troughs with flint flakes sticking up and so on—Fun and games what? Well after that none of us could look at corn and the grocery problem became acute—So we organize this protection racket shaking down the agriculturals—\"It could happen again here—Kick in or else\"—And they kicked in come level on average—Well groceries—And I had perfected a gimmick to keep my boys in line—I was still subject to these fits but I had learned to control the images—That is just before I flipped out I could put any image in the projector and—Action—Camera— Take—It always happened the way I took it and any character gave me any static was taken care of that way —But the boys from the North were moving in whole armies so we packed in and shifted to the hunting and fishing lark—I picked thirty of the most likely and suitable lads all things considered and we moved South up over the mountains and down the other side into jungle then up and over again getting monotonous—• Piecing out the odds best we could spot of this and a spot of that—Once in a while I had to put it about with the earthquakes but come level on average what you might call a journeyman thief—Well fever and snakes and rapids and boys dropping out here and there to settle down with the locals I had no mob left when I run up against this really evil setup—The Chimu were something else—So we hit this town and right away I don't like it.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Something here, John—Something wrong—I can feel it.\"</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">So I tailed the double to London on the Hook Von Holland and caught him out strangling a naked faggot in the bed sitter—I slip on the antibiotic hand cuffs and we adjourn to the Mandrake Club for an informative little chat—</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I withdrew the antibiotics and left him there with that dreamy little-boy look twisting the napkin into a hangman's knot—On the bus from the air terminal a thin grey man sat down beside me—I offered him a cigarette and he said \"Have one of mine,\" and I see he is throwing the tin on me—\"Nova police—You are Mr. Snide I believe.\" And he moved right in and shook me down looking at pictures, reading letters checking back on my time track.</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I told him what I was after and his face went a bright green with rage, \"That stupid bitch—She bringa the heat on all of us—Nova heat—\" He blew a cloud of smoke and it hung there solid in front of him—Then he wrote an address in the smoke—\"No. 88 Via di Nile, Roma.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This 88 Nile turned out to be one of those bar-soda fountains like they have in Rome—You are subject to find a maraschino cherry in your dry martini and right next to some citizen is sucking a banana split disgust you to see it—Well I am sitting there trying not to see it so I look down at the far end of the counter and dug a boy very dark with kinky hair and something Abyssinian in his face—Our eyes lock and I give him the sign—And he gives it right back—So I spit the maraschino cherry in the bartender's face and slip him a big tip and he says \"<i>Rivideci</i> and bigger.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">And I say \"Up yours with a double strawberry phosphate.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The boy finishes his Pink Lady and follows me out and I take him back to my trap and right away get into an argument with the clerk about no visitors stranezza to the hotel—Enough garlic on his breath to deter a covey of vampires—I shove a handful of lire into his mouth \"Go buy yourself some more gold teeth,\" I told him—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When this boy peeled off the dry goods he gives off a slow stink like a thawing mummy—But his asshole sucked me right in all my experience as a Private Eye never felt anything like it—In the flash bulb of orgasm I see that fucking clerk has stuck his head through the transom for a refill—Well expense account—The boy is lying there on the bed spreading out like a jelly slow tremors running through it and sighs and says: \"Almost like the real thing isn't it?\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">And I said \"I need the time milking,\" and give him the sign so heavy come near slipping a disk.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"I can see you're one of our own,\" he said warmly sucking himself back into shape—\"Dinner at eight\"— He comes back at eight in a souped up Ragazzi and we take off 160 per and scream to stop in front of a villa I can see the Bentleys and Hispano Bear Cats and Stutz Suisses and what not piled up and all the golden youth of Europe is disembarking—\"Leave your clothes in the vestibule,\" the butler tells us and we walk in on a room full of people all naked to a turn sitting around on silk stools and a bar with a pink shell behind it—This cunt undulates forward and give me the sign and holds out her hand \"I am the Contessa di Vile your hostess for tonight\"—She points to the boys at the bar with her cigarette holder and their cocks jumped up one after the other—And I did the polite thing too when my turn came—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">So all the boys began chanting in unison \"<i>The movies!</i> —<i>The movies!</i>—We want <i>the movies!</i>—\" So she led the way into the projection room which was filled with pink light seeping through the walls and floor and ceiling—The boy was explaining to me that these were actual films taken during the Abyssinian War and how lucky I was to be there—Then the action starts—There on the screen is a gallows and some young soldiers standing around with prisoners in loincloths—The soldiers are dragging this kid up onto the gallows and he biting and screaming and shitting himself and his loincloth slips off and they shove him under the noose and one of them tightens it around his neck standing there now mother naked—Then the trap fell and he drops kicking and yelping and you could hear his neck snap like a stick in a wet towel—He hangs there pulling his knees up to the chest and pumping out spurts of jissom and the audience coming right with him spurt for spurt —So the soldiers strip the loincloths off the others and they all got hard-ons waiting and watching—Got through a hundred of them more or less one at a time— Then they run the movie in slow motion slower and slower and you are coming slower and slower until it took an hour and then two hours and finally all the boys are standing there like statues getting their rocks off geologic—Meanwhile an angle comes dripping down and forms a stalactite in my brain and I slip back to the projection room and speed up the movie so the hanged boys are coming like machine guns—Half the guests explode straightaway from altered pressure chunks of limestone whistling through the air. The others are flopping around on the floor like beached idiots and the Contessa gasps out \"Carbon dioxide for the love of Kali\"—So somebody turned on the carbon dioxide tanks and I made it out of there in an aqualung—Next thing the nova heat moves in and bust the whole aquarium. \"Humm, yes, and here's another planet—\" The officer moved back dissolving most cooperative connections formed by the parasite—Self-righteous millions stabbed with rage.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"That bitch—She brings the heat three dimensional.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"The ugly cloud of smoke hung there solid female blighted continent—This turned out to be one of those association locks in Rome—I look down at the end—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">He quiets you, remember?—Finis. So I spit the planet from all the pictures and give him a place of residence with inflexible authority—Well, no terms—A hand has been taken—Your name fading looks like—Madison Avenue machine disconnected.\"</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A Russian scientist has said: \"We will travel not only in space but in time as well\"—I have just returned from a thousand-year time trip and I am here to tell you what I saw—And to tell you how such time trips are made— It is a precise operation—It is difficult—It is dangerous —It is the new frontier and only the adventurous need apply—But it belongs to <i>anyone</i> who has the courage and know-how to enter—It belongs to <i>you</i>—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I started my trip in the morgue with old newspapers, folding in today with yesterday and typing out composites—When you skip through a newspaper as most of us do you see a great deal more than you know—In fact you see it all on a subliminal level—Now when I fold today's paper in with yesterday's paper and arrange the pictures to form a time section montage, I am literally moving back to the time when I read yesterday's paper, that is traveling in time back to yesterday—I did this eight hours a day for three months—I went back as far as the papers went—I dug out old magazines and forgotten novels and letters—I made fold-ins and composites and I did the same with photos—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The next step was carried out in a film studio—I learned to talk and think backward on all levels—This was done by running film and sound track backward— For example a picture of myself eating a full meal was reversed, from satiety back to hunger—First the film was run at normal speed, then in slow-motion—The same procedure was extended to other physiological processes including orgasm—(It was explained to me that I must put aside all sexual prudery and reticence, that sex was perhaps the heaviest anchor holding one in present time.) For three months I worked with the studio—My basic training in time travel was completed and I was now ready to train specifically for the Mayan assignment—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I went to Mexico City and studied the Mayans with a team of archaeologists—The Mayans lived in what is now Yucatan, British Honduras, and Guatemala—I will not recapitulate what is known of their history, but some observations on the Mayan calendar are essential to understanding this report—The Mayan calendar starts from a mythical date 5 Ahua 8 Cumhu and rolls on to the end of the world, also a definite date depicted in the codices as a God pouring water on the earth— The Mayans had a solar, a lunar, and a ceremonial calendar rolling along like interlocking wheels from 5 Ahua 8 Cumhu to the end—The absolute power of the priests, who formed about 2 percent of the population, depended on their control of this calendar—The extent of this number monopoly can be deduced from the fact that the Mayan verbal language contains no number above ten—Modern Mayan-speaking Indians use Spanish numerals—Mayan agriculture was of the slash and burn type—They had no plows. Plows can not be used in the Mayan area because there is a strata of limestone six inches beneath the surface and the slash and burn method is used to this day—Now slash and burn agriculture is a matter of precise timing—The brush must be cut at a certain time so it will have time to dry and the burning operation carried out before the rains start—A few days' miscalculation and the year's crop is lost—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Mayan writings have not been fully deciphered, but we know that most of the hieroglyphs refer to dates in the calendar, and these numerals have been translated—It is probable that the other undeciphered symbols refer to the ceremonial calendar—There are only three Mayan codices in existence, one in Dresden, one in Paris, one in Madrid, the others having been burned by Bishop Landa—Mayan is very much a living language and in the more remote villages nothing else is spoken—More routine work—I studied Mayan and listened to it on the tape recorder and mixed Mayan in with English—I made innumerable photomontages of Mayan codices and artifacts—the next step was to find a \"vessel\"—We sifted through many candidates before settling on a young Mayan worker recently arrived from Yucatan—This boy was about twenty, almost black, with the sloping forehead and curved nose of the ancient Mayans—(The physical type has undergone little alteration)—He was illiterate—He had a history of epilepsy—He was what mediums call a \"sensitive\"— For another three months I worked with the boy on the tape recorder mixing his speech with mine—(I was quite fluent in Mayan at this point—Unlike Aztec it is an easy language.) It was time now for \"the transfer operation\"—\"I\" was to be moved into the body of this young Mayan—The operation is illegal and few are competent to practice it—I was referred to an American doctor who had become a heavy metal addict and lost his certificate—\"He is the best transfer artist in the industry\" I was told \"For a price.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">We found the doctor in a dingy office on the Avenida Cinco de Mayo—He was a thin grey man who flickered in and out of focus like an old film—I told him what I wanted and he looked at me from a remote distance without warmth or hostility or any emotion I had ever experienced in myself or seen in another—He nodded silently and ordered the Mayan boy to strip, and ran practiced fingers over his naked body—The doctor picked up a box-like instrument with electrical attachments and moved it slowly up and down the boy's back from the base of the spine to the neck—The instrument clicked like a Geiger counter—The doctor sat down and explained to me that the operation was usually performed with \"the hanging technique\"—The patient's neck is broken and during the orgasm that results he passes into the other body—This method, however, was obsolete and dangerous—For the operation to succeed you must work with a pure vessel who has not been subject to parasite invasion—Such subjects are almost impossible to find in present time he stated flatly—His cold grey eyes flicked across the young Mayan's naked body:</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"This subject is riddled with parasites—If I were to employ the barbarous method used by some of my learned colleagues—(nameless assholes)—you would be eaten body and soul by crab parasites—My technique is quite different—I operate with molds—Your body will remain here intact in deepfreeze—On your return, if you do return, you can have it back.\" He looked pointedly at my stomach sagging from sedentary city life—\"You could do with a stomach tuck, young man—But one thing at a time—The transfer operation will take some weeks—And I warn you it will be expensive.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I told him that cost was no object—The News was behind me all the way—He nodded briefly: \"Come back at this time tomorrow.\" When we returned to the doctor's office he introduced me to a thin young man who had the doctor's cool removed grey eyes—\"This is my photographer—I will make my molds from his negatives.\" The photographer told me his name was Jiminez—(\"Just call me 'Jimmy the Take'\")—We followed the \"Take\" to a studio in the same building equipped with a 35 millimeter movie camera and Mayan backdrops—He posed us naked in erection and orgasm, cutting the images in together down the middle line of our bodies—Three times a week we went to the doctor's office—He looked through rolls of film his eyes intense, cold, impersonal—And ran the clicking box up and down our spines—Then he injected a drug which he described as a variation of the apomorphine formula—The injection caused simultaneous vomiting and orgasm and several times I found myself vomiting and ejaculating in the Mayan vessel—The doctor told me these exercises were only the preliminaries and that the actual operation, despite all precautions and skills, was still dangerous enough.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">At the end of three weeks he indicated the time has come to operate—He arranged us side by side naked on the operating table under floodlights—With a phosphorescent pencil he traced the middle line of our bodies from the cleft under the nose down to the rectum —Then he injected a blue fluid of heavy cold silence as word dust fell from demagnetized patterns—From a remote Polar distance I could see the doctor separate the two halves of our bodies and fitting together a composite being—I came back in other flesh the lookout different, thoughts and memories of the young Mayan drifting through my brain—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The doctor gave me a bottle of the vomiting drug which he explained was efficacious in blocking out any control waves—He also gave me another drug which, if injected into a subject, would enable me to occupy his body for a few hours and only at night. \"Don't let the sun come up on you or it's curtains—zero eaten by crab—And now there is the matter of my fee.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I handed him a brief case of bank notes and he faded into the shadows furtive and seedy as an old junky.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The paper and the embassy had warned me that I would be on my own, a thousand years from any help— I had a vibrating camera gun sewed into my fly, a small tape recorder and a transistor radio concealed in a clay pot—I took a plane to Mérida where I set about contacting a \"broker\" who could put me in touch with a \"time guide\"—Most of these so-called \"brokers\" are old drunken frauds and my first contact was no exception—I had been warned to pay nothing until I was satisfied with the arrangements—I found this \"broker\" in a filthy hut on the outskirts surrounded by a rubbish heap of scrap iron, old bones, broken pottery and worked flints—I produced a bottle of <i>aguardiente</i> and the broker immediately threw down a plastic cup of the raw spirit and sat there swaying back and forth on a stool while I explained my business—He indicated that what I wanted was extremely difficult—Also dangerous and illegal—He could get into trouble—Besides I might be an informer from the Time Police—He would have to think about it</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">—He drank two more cups of spirit and fell on the floor in a stupor—The following day I called again—He had thought it over and perhaps—In any case he would need a week to prepare his medicines and this he could only do if he were properly supplied with <i>aguardiente</i>—And he poured another glass of spirits slopping full—Extremely dissatisfied with the way things were going I left—As I was walking back toward town a boy fell in beside me.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Hello, Meester, you look for broker yes?—Muy know good one—Him,\" he gestured back toward the hut. \"No good <i>borracho</i> son bitch bastard—Take <i>mucho dinero</i>— No do nothing—You come with me, Meester.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Thinking I could not do worse, I accompanied the boy to another hut built on stilts over a pond—A youngish man greeted us and listened silently while I explained what I wanted—The boy squatted on the floor rolling a marijuana cigarette—He passed it around and we all smoked—The broker said yes he could make the arrangements and named a price considerably lower than what I had been told to expect—How soon?—He looked at a shelf where I could see a number of elaborate hourglasses with sand in different colors: red, green, black, blue, and white—The glasses were marked with symbols—He explained to me that the sand represented color time and color words—He pointed to a symbol on the green glass, \"Then—One hour\"—He took out some dried mushrooms and herbs and began cooking them in a clay pot—As green sand touched the symbol, he filled little clay cups and handed one to me and one to the boy—I drank the bitter medicine and almost immediately the pictures I had seen of Mayan artifacts and codices began moving in my brain like animated cartoons—A spermy, compost heap smell filled the room—The boy began to twitch and mutter and fell to the floor in a fit—I could see that he had an erection under his thin trousers—The broker opened the boy's shirt and pulled off his pants—The penis flipped out spurting in orgasm after orgasm—A green light filled the room and burned through the boy's flesh—Suddenly he sat up talking in Mayan—The words curled out his mouth and hung visible in the air like vine tendrils—I felt a strange vertigo which I recognized as the motion sickness of time travel—The broker smiled and held out a hand—I passed over his fee—The boy was putting on his clothes—He beckoned me to follow and I got up and left the hut—We were walking along a jungle hut the boy ahead his whole body alert and twitching like a dog—We walked many hours and it was dawn when we came to a clearing where I could see a number of workers with sharp sticks and gourds of seed planting corn—The boy touched my shoulder and disappeared up the path in jungle dawn mist—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As I stepped forward into the clearing and addressed one of the workers, I felt the crushing weight of evil insect control forcing my thoughts and feelings into prearranged molds, squeezing my spirit in a soft invisible vise—The worker looked at me with dead eyes empty of curiosity or welcome and silently handed me a planting stick—It was not unusual for strangers to wander in out of the jungle since the whole area was ravaged by soil exhaustion—So my presence occasioned no comment—I worked until sundown—I was assigned to a hut by an overseer who carried a carved stick and wore an elaborate headdress indicating his rank—I lay down in the hammock and immediately felt stabbing probes of telepathic interrogation—I turned on the thoughts of a half-witted young Indian—After some hours the invisible presence withdrew—I had passed the first test—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">During the months that followed I worked in the fields—The monotony of this existence made my disguise as a mental defective quite easy—I learned that one could be transferred from field work to rock carving the stellae after a long apprenticeship and only after the priests were satisfied that any thought of resistance was forever extinguished—I decided to retain the anonymous status of a field worker and keep as far as possible out of notice—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A continuous round of festivals occupied our evenings and holidays—On these occasions the priests appeared in elaborate costumes, often disguised as centipedes or lobsters—Sacrifices were rare, but I witnessed one revolting ceremony in which a young captive was tied to a stake and the priests tore his sex off with white-hot copper claws—I learned also something of the horrible punishments meted out to anyone who dared challenge or even think of challenging the controllers: <i>Death in the Ovens</i>: The violator was placed in a construction of interlocking copper grills—The grills were then heated to white heat and slowly closed on his body. <i>Death In Centipede</i>: The \"criminal\" was strapped to a couch and eaten alive by giant centipedes—These executions were carried out secretly in rooms under the temple.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I made recordings of the festivals and the continuous music like a shrill insect frequency that followed the workers all day in the fields—However, I knew that to play these recordings would invite immediate detection—I needed not only the sound track of control but the image track as well before I could take definitive action—I have explained that the Mayan control system depends on the calendar and the codices which contain symbols representing all states of thought and feeling possible to human animals living under such limited circumstances—These are the instruments with which they rotate and control units of thought—I found out also that the priests themselves do not understand exactly how the system works and that I undoubtedly knew more about it than they did as a result of my intensive training and studies—The technicians who had devised the control system had died out and the present line of priests were in the position of some one who knows what buttons to push in order to set a machine in motion, but would have no idea how to fix that machine if it broke down, or to construct another if the machine were destroyed—If I could gain access to the codices and mix the sound and image track the priests would go on pressing the old buttons with unexpected results—In order to accomplish the purpose I prostituted myself to one of the priests—(Most distasteful thing I ever stood still for)—During the sex act he metamorphosed himself into a green crab from the waist up, retaining human legs and genitals that secreted a caustic erogenous slime, while a horrible stench filled the hut—I was able to endure these horrible encounters by promising myself the pleasure of killing this disgusting monster when the time came— And my reputation as an idiot was by now so well established that I escaped all but the most routine control measures—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The priest had me transferred to janitor work in the temple where I witnessed some executions and saw the prisoners torn body and soul into writhing insect fragments by the ovens, and learned that the giant centipedes were born in the ovens from these mutilated screaming fragments—It was time to act—Using the drug the doctor had given me, I took over the priest's body, gained access to the room where the codices were kept, and photographed the books—Equipped now with sound and image track of the control machine I was in position to dismantle it—I had only to mix the order of recordings and the order of images and the changed order would be picked up and fed back into the machine—I had recordings of all agricultural operations, cutting and burning brush etc.—I now correlated the recordings of burning brush with the image track of this operation, and shuffled the time so that the order to burn came late and a year's crop was lost— Famine weakening control lines, I cut radio static into the control music and festival recordings together with sound and image track rebellion.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Cut word lines—Cut music lines—Smash the control images—Smash the control machine—Burn the books— Kill the priests—Kill! Kill! Kill!—\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Inexorably as the machine had controlled thought feeling and sensory impressions of the workers, the machine now gave the order to dismantle itself and kill the priests—I had the satisfaction of seeing the overseer pegged out in the field, his intestines perforated with hot planting sticks and crammed with corn—I broke out my camera gun and rushed the temple—This weapon takes and vibrates image to radio static—You see the priests <i>were</i> nothing but word and image, an old film rolling on and on with dead actors—Priests and temple guards went up in silver smoke as I blasted my way into the control room and burned the codices— Earthquake tremors under my feet I got out of there fast, blocks of limestone raining all around me—A great weight fell from the sky, winds of the earth whipping palm trees to the ground—Tidal waves rolled over the Mayan control calendar.</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"What is all this scandal?\" The Comandante in clean khaki was standing on a platform overlooking the square. Above him was an elaborate multileveled building of bamboo. His shirt was open on a brown chest smooth as old ivory. A little pistol in red leather cover crawled slowly across his skin leaving an iridescent trail of slime.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"You must forgive my staff if they do not quite measure up to your German ideal of spit and polish. . . backward. . . uninstructed. . . each living all alone and cultivating his little virus patch. . . They have absolutely nothing to do and the solitude. . .\" He tapped his forehead. His face melted and changed under the flickering arc lights.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"But there must be thirty of them about,\" said Carl.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Comandante gave him a sharp look. \"They are synchronized of course. They can not see or even infer each other so all think he is only police officer on post. Their lines you <i>sabe</i> never cross and some of them are already...\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"And some of them are already dead. This is awkward since they are not legally responsible. We try to bury them on time even if they retain intact protest reflex. Like Gonzalez the Earth Eater. We bury him three times.\" The Comandante held up three fingers sprouting long white tendrils. \"Always he eat way out. And now if you will excuse me the soccer scores are coming in from the Capital. One must pretend an interest.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Comandante had aged from remote crossroads of Time crawled into a metal locker and shut the door whimpering with fears, emerged in a moldy green jockstrap his body painted I-red, U-green. The Assistant flared out of a broom closet high on ammonia with a green goatee and marble face. He removed Carl's clothes in a series of locks and throws. Carl could feel his body move to the muscle orders. The Assistant put a pail over his head and screamed away into distant hammers.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Comandante spread jelly over Carl's naked paralyzed body. The Comandante was molding a woman. Carl could feel his body draining into the woman mold. His genitals dissolving, tits swelling as the Comandante penetrated applying a few touches to face and hair—(Jissom across the mud wall in the dawn sound of barking dogs and running water—) Down there the Comandante going through his incantations around Carl's empty body. The body rose presenting an erection, masturbates in front of the Comandante. Penis flesh spreads through his body bursting in orgasm explosions granite cocks ejaculate lava under a black cloud boiling with monster crustaceans. Cold grey undersea eyes and hands touched Carl's body. The Comandante flipped him over with sucker hands and fastened his disk mouth to Carl's asshole. He was lying in a hammock of green hair, penis-flesh hammers bursting his body. Hairs licked his rectum, spiraling tendrils scraping pleasure centers, Carl's body emptied in orgasm after orgasm, bones lit up green through flesh dissolved into the disk mouth with a fluid plop. He quivers red now in boneless spasms, pink waves through his body at touch of the green hairs.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Comandante stripped Carl's body and smeared on green jelly nipples that pulled the flesh up and in. Carl's genitals wither to dry shit he sweeps clear with a little whisk broom to white flesh and black shiny pubic hairs. The Comandante parts the hairs and makes Incision with a little curved knife. Now he is modeling a face from the picture of his <i>novia</i> in the Capital.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"And now, how you say, 'the sound effects.'\" He puts on a record of her voice, Carl's lips follow and the female substance breathed in the words.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Oh love of my <i>alma!</i> Oh wind of morning!\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Most distasteful thing I ever stand still for.\" Carl made words in the air without a throat, without a tongue. \"I hope there is a <i>farmacia</i> in the area.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Comandante looked at him with annoyance: \"You could wait in the office please.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">He came out putting on his tunic and strapping on a Luger.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"A drugstore? Yes I <i>creo</i>. . . Across the lagoon. . . I will call the guide.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Carl walked through a carnival city along canals where giant pink salamanders and goldfish stirred slowly, penny arcades, tattoo booths, massage parlors, side shows, blue movies, processions, floats, performers, pitchmen to the sky.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Puerto Joselito is located Dead Water. Inactive oil wells and mine shafts, strata of abandoned machinery and gutted boats, garbage of stranded operations and expeditions that died at this point of dead land where sting rays bask in brown water and grey crabs walk the mud flats on brittle stilt legs. The town crops up from the mud flats to the silent temple of high jungle streams of clear water cut deep clefts in yellow clay and falling orchids endanger the traveler.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In a green savanna stand two vast penis figures in black stone, legs and arms vestigial, slow blue smoke rings pulsing from the stone heads. A limestone road winds through the pillars and into The City. A rack of rusty iron and concrete set in vacant lots and rubble, dotted with chemical gardens. A smell of junky hat and death about the town deadens and weight these sentences with \"disgust you to see it.\" Carl walked through footpaths of a vast shanty town. A dry wind blows hot and cold down from Chimborazo a soiled post card in the prop blue sky. Crab men peer out of abandoned quarries and shag heaps some sort of vestigial eye growing cheek bone and a look about them as if they could take root and grow on anybody, muttering addicts of the orgasm drug, boneless in the sun, gurgling throat gristle, heart pulsing slowly in transparent flesh eaten alive by the crab men.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Carl walked through the penis posts into a town of limestone huts. A ring of priests sat around the posts legs spread, erections pulsing to flicker light from their eyes. As he walked through the electric eyes his lips swelled and his lungs rubbed against the soft inner ribs. He walked over and touched one of the priests and a shock threw him across the road into a sewage ditch. Maize fields surround the town with stone figures of the Young Corn God erect penis spurting maize shoots looks down with young cruelty and innocent lips parted slightly terminal caress in the dropping eyes. The Young Corn God is led out and his robes of corn silk stripped from his body by lobster priests. A vine rope is attached to the stone penis of the Maize God. The boy's cock rises iridescent in the morning sun and you can see the other room from there by a mirror on the wardrobe. . . Well now, in the city a group of them came to this valley grow corn do a bit of hunting fishing in the river.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Carl walked a long row of living penis urns made from men whose penis has absorbed the body with vestigial arms and legs breathing through purple fungoid gills and dropping a slow metal excrement like melted solder forms a solid plaque under the urns stand about three feet high on rusty iron shelves wire mesh cubicles joined by catwalks and ladders a vast warehouse of living penis urns slowly transmuting to smooth red terra cotta. Others secrete from the head crystal pearls of lubricant that forms a shell of solid crystal over the red penis flesh.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A blast of golden horns: \"The Druid priest emerges from the Sacred Grove, rotting bodies hang about him like Spanish moss. His eyes blue and cold as liquid air expand and contract eating light.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The boy sacrifice is chosen by erection acclaim, universal erection feeling for him until all pricks point to \"Yes.\" Boy feels the \"Yes\" run through him and melt his bones to \"Yes\" stripped naked in the Sacred Grove shivering and twitching under the Hanging Tree green disk mouths sucking his last bone meal. He goes to the Tree naked on flower floats through the obsidian streets red stone buildings and copper pagodas of the Fish City stopping in Turkish Baths and sex rooms to make blue movies with youths. The entire city is in heat during this ceremony, faces swollen with tumescent purple penis flesh. Lightning fucks flash on any street corner leave a smell of burning metal blue sparks up and down the spine. A vast bath-town of red clay cubicles over twisting geological orgasm with the green crab boys disk mouths' slow rasping tongues on spine centers twisting in the warm black ooze.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Noteworthy is the Glazing Ceremony when certain of the living urns are covered with terra cotta and baked in red brick ovens by the women who pull the soft red meat out with their penis forks and decorate house and garden with the empty urns. The urnings for the Glazing Ceremony are chosen each day by locker number from the public urn and numbers read out over the soft speaker inside the head. Helpless urns listening to the number call charge our soft terror-eating substance, our rich substance.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Now it is possible to beat the number before call by fixing the urn or after call by the retroactive fix which few are competent to practice. There is also a Ceremonial Massage in which the penis flesh is rubbed in orgasm after orgasm until Death in Centipede occurs. Death in Centipede is the severest sentence of the Insect Court and of course all urnings are awaiting sentence for various male crimes. <i>Pues</i>, every year a few experienced urnings beat the house and make Crystal Grade. When the crystal cover reaches a certain thickness the urning is exempt from ceremonial roll call and becomes immortal with nothing to do but slowly accrete a thicker cover in the Crystal Hall of Fame.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Few beat the house, a vast limestone bat. High mountain valley cut off by severest sentence of symbiotic cannibalism. So the game with one another.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"I dunno me. Only work here. Technical Sergeant.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Throw it into wind Jack.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A pimp leans in through the Country Club window. \"Visit the House of David boys and watch the girls eat shit. Makes a man feel good all over. Just tell the madam a personal friend of mine.\" He drops a cuneiform cylinder into the boy's hip pocket feeling his ass with lost tongue of the penis urn people in a high mountain valley of symbiotic cannibalism. The natives are blond and blue-eyed sex in occupation. It is unlawful to have orgasm alone and the inhabitants live in a hive of sex rooms and flickering blue movie cubicles. You can spot one on the cubicle skyline miles away. We all live in the blue image forever. The cubicles fade out in underground steam baths where lurk the Thurlings, malicious boys' spirits fugitive from the blue movie who mislead into underground rivers. (The traveler is eaten by aquatic centipedes and carnivorous underwater vines.)</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Orgasm death spurts over the flower floats—Limestone God a mile away—Descent into penis flesh cut off by a group of them came to this game under the Hanging Tree—Insect legs under red Arctic night—He wore my clothes and terror—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The boy ejaculates blood over the flower floats. Slow vine rope drops him in a phallic fountain, wire mesh cubicles against the soft inner ribs, vast warehouse of penis and the shock threw him ten feet to smooth dirt and flak. God with erect penis spurting crystal young cruelty and foe solid, dazzling terminal caress in silent corridors of Corn God. erection feeling for descent in the morning sun feels the \"Yes\" from there by a mirror on you stripped naked. In the city a group of them came to this last bone meal under the Hanging Tree.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Pretty familiar.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Priests came through the Limestone Gates playing green flutes: translucent lobster men with wild blue eyes and shells of flexible copper. A soundless vibration in the spine touched center of erection and the natives moved toward the flute notes on a stiffening blood tube for the Centipede Rites. A stone penis body straddles the opening to the cave room of steam baths and sex cubicles and the green cab boys who go all the way on any line.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Natives insert a grill of silver wires deep into the sinus where a crystal slowly forms. They strum the wires with insect hairs growing through flesh weaving cold cocaine sex frequencies.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">From The Living God Cock flows a stream of lubricant into a limestone trough green with algae. The priests arrange the initiates into long dog-fuck lines molding them together with green jelly from the lubricant tanks. Now the centipede skin is strapped on each body a segment and the centipede whips and cracks in electric spasms of pleasure throwing off segments kicking spasmodically uncontrolled diarrhea spurting orgasm after orgasm synchronized with the flicker lights. Carl is taken by the centipede legs and pulled into flesh jelly dissolving bones—Thick black hair sprouts through his tumescent flesh—He falls through a maze of penny arcades and dirty pictures, locker rooms, barracks, and prison flesh empty with the colorless smell of death—</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Cold metal excrement on all the walls and benches, silver sky raining the metal word fallout—Sex sweat like iron in the mouth. Scores are coming in. Pretend an interest.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In a puppet booth the manipulator takes pictures of bored insolent catatonics with eight-hour erections reading comics and chewing gum. The impresario is a bony Nordic with green fuzz on his chest and legs. \"I get mine later with the pictures. I can't touch the performers. Wall of glass you know show you something interesting.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">He pulls aside curtain: schoolboy room with a banner and pin-ups, on the bed naked boy puppet reading comics and chewing gum with a hypo.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Ghost your German. Spit penny arcades, tattoo booths, Nordic processions, human performers, trapeze artists. Whores of all sexes importune from scenic railways and ferris wheels where they rent cubicles, push up manhole covers in a puff of steam, pull at passing pant cuffs, careen out of the Tunnel of Love waving condoms of jissom. Old blind queens with dirty peep shows built into their eye sockets disguise themselves as penny arcades and feel for a young boy's throbbing cock with cold metal hands, sniff pensively at bicycle seats in Afghan Hound drag, Puerto Joselito is located through legs. Ghost slime sitting naked on tattoo booths, virus flesh of curse, suffocating town, this. Ways to bury explorer.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Old junky street cleaners push little red wagons sweeping up condoms and empty H caps, KY tubes, broken trusses and sex devices, kif garbage and confetti, moldy jockstraps and bloody Kotex, shit-stained color comics, dead kitten and afterbirths, jenshe babies of berdache and junky.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Everywhere the soft insidious voice of the Pitchman delayed action language lesson muttering under all your pillows \"Shows all kinds masturbation and self-abuse. Young boys need it special.\"</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Carl descended a spiral iron stairwell into a labyrinth of lockers, tier on tier of wire mesh and steel cubicles joined by catwalks and ladders and moving cable cars as far as he could see, tiers shifting interpenetrating swinging beams of construction, blue flare of torches on the intent young faces, locker room smell of moldy jockstraps, chlorine and burning metal, escalators and moving floors start stop change course, synchronize with balconies and perilous platforms eaten with rust. Ferris wheels silently penetrate the structure, roller coasters catapult through to the clear sky—a young workman walks the steel beams with the sun in his hair out of sight in a maze of catwalks and platforms where coffee fires smoke in rusty barrels and the workers blow on their black cotton gloves in the clear cold morning through to the sky beams with sun in his hair the workers blow on their cold morning, dropped down into the clicking turnstiles, buzzers, lights and stuttering torches smell of ozone. Breakage is constant. Whole tiers shift and crash in a yellow cloud of rust, spill boys masturbating on careening toilets, iron urinals trailing a wake of indecent exposure, old men in rocking chairs screaming antifluoride slogans, a Southern Senator sticks his fat frog face out of the outhouse and brays with inflexible authority: \"And Ah advocates the extreme penalty in the worst form there is for anyone convicted of trafficking in, transporting, selling or caught in using the narcotic substance known as nutmeg. . . I wanna say further that ahm a true friend of the Nigra and understand all his simple wants. Why, I got a good Darkie in here now wiping my ass.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Wreckage and broken bodies litter the girders, slowly collected by old junkies pushing little red wagons patient and calm with gentle larcenous old woman fingers, gathering blue torch flares light the calm intent young worker faces.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Carl descended a spiral iron smell of ozone. Breakage is of lockers tier on tier crash in yellow cloud as far as he could see of indecent exposure on toilets. Swinging beams construct the intent young faces.</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Locker room toilet on five levels seen from the ferris wheel, flash of white legs, shiny pubic hairs and lean brown arms, boys masturbating with soap under rusty showers form a serpent line beating on the lockers, vibrates through all the tiers and cubicles unguarded platforms and dead-end ladders dangling in space, workers straddling beams beat out runic tunes with shiny ball peen hammers. The universe shakes with metallic adolescent lust. The line disappears through a green door slide down to the subterranean baths twisting through torch flares the melodious boy-cries drift out of ventilators in all the locker rooms, barracks, schools and prisons of the world. \"Joselito, Paco, Enrique.\"</span></p>\n",
      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Jacking off he is whiff stateroom that is always kept locked—and word dust dirtied his body falling through the space between worlds—</span></p>\n",

      "<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Ghosts of Panama clung to our bodies—\"You come with me, Meester?\"—On the boy's breath a flesh—His body slid from my hands in soap bubbles—We twisted slowly to the yellow sands, traced fossils of orgasm—</span></p>\n",

The red haired boy made a slight choking sound as blood rushed to his face pounded and sang in his ears. The young face there on the landing turned black around the edges.
