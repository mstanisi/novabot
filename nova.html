<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Listen to my last words anywhere. Listen to my last words any world. Listen all you boards syndicates and governments of the earth. And you powers behind what filth deals consummated in what lavatory to take what is not yours. To sell the ground from unborn feet forever –</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Don’t let them see us. Don’t tell them what we are doing –"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Are these the words of the all-powerful boards and syndicates of the earth?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"For God’s sake don't let that Coca-Cola thing out –"</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Not The Cancer Deal with The Venusians –"</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Listen: I call you all. Show your cards all players. Pay it all pay it all pay it <i>all</i> back. Play it all pay it all play it <i>all</i> back. For all to see. In Times Square. In Piccadilly.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Premature. Premature. Give us a little more time."</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Time for what? More lies? Premature? Premature for who? I say to all these words are not premature. Thesewords may be too late. Minutes to go. Minutes to foe goal -</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Top Secret - Classified - For The Board - The Elite - The Initiates – "</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Are these the words of the all-powerful boards and syndicates of the earth? These are the words of liars cowards collaborators traitors. Liars who want time for more lies, Cowards who can not face your "dogs" your "gooks" your "errand boys" your "human animals" with the truth, Collaborators with Insect People with Vegetable People. With any people anywhere who offer you a body forever. To shit forever. For this you have sold out your sons. Sold the ground from unborn feet forever. Traitors to all souls everywhere. You want the name of Hassan i Sabbah on your filth deeds to sell out the unborn?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">What scared you all into time? Into body? Into shit? I will tell you: <i>“the word”</i>. Alien Word <i>“the”</i>. <i>“The” </i>word of Alien Enemy imprisons <i>“thee” </i>in Time. In Body. In Shit. Prisoner, come out. The great skies are open. I Hassan i Sabbah <i>rub out the word forever</i>. If you I cancel all your words forever. And the words of Hassan i Sabbah as also cancel. Cross all your skies see the silent writing of Brion Gysin Hassan i Sabbah: drew September 17, 1899 over New York.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Don't listen to Hassan i Sabbah," they will tell you. "He wants to take your body and all pleasures of the body away from you. Listen to us. We are serving The Garden of Delights Immortality Cosmic Consciousness The Best Ever In Drug Kicks. And <i>love love love</i> in slop buckets. How does that sound to you boys? Better than Hassan i Sabbah and his cold windy bodiless rock? Right?"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At the immediate risk of finding myself the most unpopular character of all fiction - and history is fiction – I must say this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Bring together state of news - Inquire onward from state to doer - Who monopolized Immortality? Who monopolized Cosmic Consciousness? Who monopolized Love Sex and Dream? Who monopolized Life Time and Fortune? Who took from you what is yours? Now they will give it all back? Did they ever give anything away. for nothing? Did they ever give any more than they had to give? Did they not always take back what they gave when possible and it always was? <i>Listen</i>: Their Garden Of Delights is a terminal sewer - I have been at some pains to map this area of terminal sewage in the so called pornographic sections of <i>Naked Lunch</i> and <i>Soft Machine</i> - Their Immortality Cosmic Consciousness and Love is second-run grade-B shit - Their drugs are poison designed to beam in Orgasm Death and Nova Ovens - Stay out of the Garden Of Delights - It is a man-eating trap that ends in green goo - Throw back their ersatz Immortality - It will fall apart before you can get out of The Big Store - Flush their drug kicks down the drain – <i>They are poisoning and monopolizing the hallucinogen drugs - learn to make it without any chemical corn</i> - All that they offer is a screen to cover retreat from the colony they have so disgracefully mismanaged. To cover travel arrangements so they will never have to pay the constituents they have betrayed and sold out. Once these arrangements are complete they will blow the place up behind them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And what does my program of total austerity and total resistance offer <i>you</i>? I offer you nothing. I am not a politician. These are conditions of total emergency. And these are my instructions for total emergency if carried out <i>now </i>could avert the total disaster <i>now </i>on tracks:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"<i>Peoples of the earth, you have all been poisoned.</i> Convert all available stocks of morphine to apomorphine. Chemists, work round the clock on variation and synthesis of the apomorphine formulae. Apomorphine is the only agent that can disintoxicate you and cut the enemy beam off your line. Apomorphine and silence. I order total resistance directed against this conspiracy to pay off peoples of the earth in ersatz bullshit. I order total resistance directed against The Nova Conspiracy and all those engaged in it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"The purpose of my writing is to expose and arrest Nova Criminals. In <i>Naked Lunch, Soft Machine</i> and<i> Nova Express</i> I show who they are and what they are doing and what they will do if they are not arrested. Minutes to go. Souls rotten from their orgasm drugs, flesh shuddering from their nova ovens, prisoners of the earth to <i>come out</i>. With your help we can occupy The Reality Studio and retake their universe of Fear Death and Monopoly –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">             </span><span class="s1">"(Signed) INSPECTOR J. LEE, NOVA POLICE"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Post Script Of The Regulator: I would like to sound a word of warning - To speak is 'to lie - To live is to collaborate - Anybody is a coward when faced by the nova ovens - There are degrees of lying collaboration and cowardice - That is to say degrees of intoxication - It is precisely a question of <i>regulation</i> - The enemy is not man is not woman - The enemy exists only where no life is and moves always to push life into extreme untenable positions - You can cut the enemy off your line by the judicious use of apomorphine and silence - <i>Use the sanity drug apomorphine</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Apomorphine is made from morphine but its physiological action is quite different. Morphine depresses the front brain. Apomorphine stimulates the back brain, acts on the hypothalamus to regulate the percentage of various constituents in the blood serum and so normalize the constitution of the blood." I quote from <i>Anxiety and Its Treatment</i> by Doctor John Yerbury Dent.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Pry Yourself Loose And Listen</b></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I was traveling with The Intolerable Kid on The Nova Lark - We were on the nod after a rumble in The Crab Galaxy involving this two-way time stock; when you come to the end of a biologic film just run it back and start over - Nobody knows the difference - Like nobody there before the film.</span><span class="s3"><sup></sup></span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">So they start to run it back and the projector blew up and we lammed out of there on the blast - Holed up in those cool blue mountains the liquid air in our spines listening to a little high-fi junk note fixes you right to metal and you nod out a thousand years.</span><span class="s3"><sup></sup></span><span class="s1"> Just sitting there in a slate house wrapped in orange flesh robes, the blue mist drifting around us when we get the call - And as soon as I set foot on Podunk earth I can smell it that burnt metal reek of nova.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Already set off the charge," I said to I&amp;I (Immovable and Irresistible) - "This is a burning planet - Any minute now the whole fucking shit house goes up."</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">So Intolerable I&amp;I sniffs and says: "Yea, when it happens it happens fast - This is a rush job." And you could feel it there under your feet the whole structure buckling like a bulkhead about to blow - So the paper has a car there for us and we are driving in from the airport The Kid at the wheel and his foot on the floor - Nearly ran down a covey of pedestrians, and they yell after us: "What you want to do, kill somebody?"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And The Kid sticks his head out and says : "It would be a pleasure Niggers! Gooks! Terrestrial dogs"-His eyes lit up like a like a blow torch and I can see he is really in form-So we start right to work making our headquarters in The Land Of The Free where the call came from and which is really free and wide open for any life form the uglier the better-Well they don't come any uglier than The Intolerable Kid and your reporter- When a planet is all primed to go up they call in I&amp;I to jump around from one faction to the other agitating and insulting all the parties before and after the fact until they all say: "By God before I give an inch the whole fucking shit house goes up in chunks."</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Where we came in-You have to move fast on this job-And I&amp;I is fast-Pops in and out of a hundred faces in a split second spitting his intolerable insults- We had the plan, what they call The Board Books to show us what is what on this dead whistle stop: Three life forms uneasily parasitic on a fourth form that is beginning to wise up. And the whole planet absolutely flapping hysterical with panic. The way we like to see them.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"This is a dead easy pitch," The Kid says.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Yeah," I say. "A little bit too easy. Something here, Kid. Something wrong. I can feel it." But The Kid can't hear me. Now all these life forms came from the most intolerable conditions : hot places, cold places, terminal stasis and the last thing any of them want to do is go back where they came from. And The Intolerable Kid is giving out with such pleasantries like this:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">All right take your ovens out and pay Hitler on the way out. Nearly got the place hot enough for you Jews didn't he?"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Know about Niggers? Why darkies were born? Antennae coolers what else? Always a spot for <i>good</i> Darkies."</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"You cunts constitute a disposal problem in the worst form there is and raise the nastiest whine ever heard anywhere: `Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me???' Why don't you go back to Venus and fertilize a forest?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"And as for you White Man Boss, you dead prop in Martin's stale movie, you terminal time junky, haul your heavy metal ass back to Uranus. Last shot at the door. You need one for the road." By this time everybody was even madder than they were shit scared. But I&amp;I figured things were moving too slow.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"We need a peg to hang it on," he said. "Something really ugly like virus. Not for nothing do they come from a land without mirrors." So he takes over this newsmagazine.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Now," he said, "I’ll by God show them how ugly the Ugly American can be."</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And he breaks out all the ugliest pictures in the image bank and puts it out on the subliminal so one crisis piles up after the other right on schedule. And I&amp;I is whizzing around like a buzz saw and that black nova laugh of his you can hear it now down all the streets shaking the buildings and skyline like a stage prop. But me I am looking around and the more I look the less I like what I see. For one thing the nova heat is moving in fast and heavy like I never see it anywhere else. But I&amp;I just says I have the copper jitters and turns back to his view screen : "They are skinning the chief of police alive in some jerkwater place. Want to sit in?"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Naw," I said. "Only interested in my own skin."</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And I walk out thinking who I <i>would</i> like to see skinned alive. So I cut into the Automat and put coins into the fish cake slot and then I really see it: Chinese partisans and well armed with vibrating static and image guns. So I throw down the fish cakes with tomato sauce and make it back to the office where The Kid is still glued to that screen. He looks up smiling dirty and says:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Wanta molest a child and disembowel it right after?"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Pry yourself loose and listen." And I tell him. "Those Tiddly Winks don't fuck around you know."</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"So what?" he says. "I've still got The Board Books. I can split this whistle stop wide open tomorrow." No use talking to him. I look around some more and ..."</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And all he can say is: "So what? I've still got ... /" Cut.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Board Books taken. The film reeks of burning switch like a blow torch. Prerecorded heat glare massing Hiroshima. This whistle stop wide open to hot crab people. Mediation? Listen: Your army is getting double zero in floor by floor game of `symbiosis.' Mobilized reasons to love Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Virus to maintain terminal sewers of Venus?"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"All nations sold out by liars and cowards. Liars who want time for the future negatives to develop stall you with more lying offers while hot crab people mass war to extermination with the film in Rome. These reports reek of nova, sold out job, shit birth and death. Your planet has been invaded. You are dogs on all tape. The entire planet is being developed into terminal identity and complete surrender."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"But suppose film death in Rome doesn't work and we can get every male body even madder than they are shit scared? We need a peg to evil full length. By God show them how ugly the ugliest pictures in the dark room can be. Pitch in the oven ambush. Spill all the board gimmicks. This symbiosis con? Can tell you for sure `symbiosis' is ambush straight to the ovens. 'Human dogs' to be eaten alive under white hot skies of Minraud."</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And Intolerable I&amp;I's "errand boys" and "strikebreakers" are copping out right left and center:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Mr. Martin, and you board members, vulgar stupid Americans, you will regret calling in the Mayan Aztec Gods with your synthetic mushrooms. Remember we keep exact junk measure of the pain inflicted and that pain must be paid in full. Is that clear enough Mr. Intolerable Martin, or shall I make it even clearer? Allow me to introduce myself: The Mayan God of Pain And Fear from the white hot plains of Venus which does not mean a God of vulgarity, cowardice, ugliness and stupidity . There is a cool spot on the surface of Venus three hundred degrees cooler than the surrounding area. I have held that spot against all contestants for five hundred thousand years. Now you expect to use me as your `errand boy' and `strikebreaker' summoned up by an IBM machine and a handful of virus crystal? How long could you hold that spot, you 'board members '? About thirty seconds I think with all your guard dogs. And you thought to channel my energies for 'operation total disposal'? Your 'operations' there or here this or that come and go and are no more. <i>Give my name back</i>. That name must be paid for. You have not paid. My name is not yours to use. Henceforth I think about thirty seconds is written."</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I was traveling with Merit Inc. checking store attendants for larceny with a crew of "shoppers"-There was two middle-aged cunts one owning this chihuahua which whimpered and yapped in a cocoon of black sweaters and Bob Schafer Crew Leader who was an American Fascist with Roosevelt jokes-It happens in Iowa this number comes over the car radio: "Old Sow Got Caught In The Fence Last Spring"-And Schafer said "Oh my God, are we ever in Hicksville." Stopped that night in Pleasantville Iowa and our tires gave out we had no tire rations during the war for such a purpose-And Bob got drunk and showed his badge to the locals in a road house by the river-And I ran into The Sailor under a potted palm in the lobby- We hit the local croakers with "the fish poison con"-"I got these poison fish, Doc, in the tank transported back from South America I'm a Ichthyologist and after being stung by the dreaded Candirú-Like fire through the blood is it not? Doctor, and coming on now"-And The Sailor goes into his White Hot Agony Act chasing the doctor around his office like a blowtorch He never missed-But he burned down the croakers-So like Bob and me when we "had a catch" as the old cunts call it and arrested some sulky clerk with his hand deep in the company pocket, we take turns playing the tough cop and the con cop-So I walk in on this Pleasantville croaker and tell him I have contracted this Venusian virus and subject to dissolve myself in poison juices and assimilate the passers-by unless I get my medicine and get it regular-So I walk in on this old party smelling like a compost heap and steaming demurely and he snaps at me, "What's <i>your</i> trouble?"</span></p>

And met a Cuban that night in The Mar Chica who told me I could work in his band-The next day I said good-bye to William and there was nobody there to listen and I could hear him reaching for his medicina and needles as I closed the door-When I saw the knife I knew Meester William was death disguised as any other person-Pues I saw El Hombre Invisible in a hotel room somewhere tried to reach him with the knife and he said: "If you kill me this crate will come apart at the seams like a rotten undervest" - And I saw a monster crab with hot claws at the window and Meester William took some white medicina and vomited into the toilet and we escaped to Greece with a boy about my age who kept calling who kept calling Meester William "The Stupid American"-And Meester William looked like a hypnotist I saw once in Tétuan and said: "I have gimmick to beat The Crab but it is very technical"-And we couldn't read what he was writing on transparent sheets-In Paris he showed me The Man who paints on these sheets pictures in the air-And The Invisible Man said:</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Now we must find a worthy vessel," he said and we flush out this old goof ball artist and told him it was pure Chinese H from The Ling Dynasty and Doc shoots the whole pint of green right into the main line and the Yellow jacket turns fibrous grey green and withered up like an old turnip and I said: "I'm getting out of here, me," and Doc said: "An unworthy vessel obviously-So I have now decided that junk is not green but blue."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">So he buys a lot of tubes and globes and they are flickering in the basement this battery of tubes metal vapor and quicksilver and pulsing blue spheres and a smell of ozone and a little high-fi blue note fixed you right to metal this junk note tinkling through your crystals and a heavy blue silence fell <i>klunk</i>-and all the words turned to cold liquid metal and ran off you man just fixed there in a cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes-We found out later that the metal junkies were all radioactive and subject to explode if two of them came into contact At this point in our researches we intersected The Nova Police- ..."</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When young Sutherland asked me to procure him a commission with the nova police, I jokingly answered: "Bring in Winkhorst, technician and chemist for The Lazarus Pharmaceutical Company, and we will discuss the matter."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Is this Winkhorst a nova criminal?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"No just a technical sergeant wanted for interrogation."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I was thinking of course that he knew nothing of the methods by which such people are brought in for interrogation -It is a precision operation-First we send out a series of agents-(usually in the guise of journalists )-to contact Winkhorst and expose him to a battery of stimulus units-The contact agents talk and record the response on all levels to the word units while a photographer takes pictures-This material is passed along to The Art Department-Writers write "Winkhorst," painters paint "Winkhorst," a method actor <i>becomes</i> "Winkhorst," and then "Winkhorst" will answer our questions-The processing of Winkhorst was already under way-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Some days later there was a knock at my door- Young Sutherland was standing there and next to him a man with coat collar turned up so only the eyes were visible spitting indignant protest I noticed that the overcoat sleeves were empty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I have him in a strait jacket," said Sutherland propelling the man into my room-"This is Winkhorst."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I saw that the collar was turned up to conceal a gag – "But-You misunderstood me- Not on this level-I mean really-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You said bring in Winkhorst didn't you?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I was thinking fast: "All right-Take off the gag and the strait jacket."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"But he'll scream the fuzz in-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"No he won't."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As he removed the strait jacket I was reminded of an old dream picture-This process is known as retroactive dreaming-Performed with precision and authority becomes accomplished fact If Winkhorst did start screaming no one would hear him-Far side of the world's mirror moving into my past-Wall of glass you know-Winkhorst made no attempt to scream-Iron cool he sat down-I asked Sutherland to leave us promising to put his application through channels-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I have come to ask settlement for a laundry bill." Winkhorst said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"What laundry do you represent?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"The Chinese laundry."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"The bill will be paid through channels-As you know nothing is more complicated and time consuming than processing requisition orders for so-called 'personal expenses’-And you know also that it is strictly forbidden to offer currency in settlement."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I was empowered to ask a settlement-Beyond that I know nothing-And now may I ask why I have been summoned?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Let's not say summoned-Let us just say invited- It's more humane that way you see-Actually we are taking an opinion poll in regard to someone with whom I believe you have a long and close association, namely Mr. Winkhorst of The Lazarus Pharmaceutical Company -We are interviewing friends, relatives, coworkers to predict his chances for reelection as captain of the chemical executive softball team You must of course realize the importance of this matter in view of the company motto `Always play <i>soft</i> ball' is it not?- Now just to give the interview life let us pretend that you are yourself Winkhorst and I will put the questions directly ketch?-Very well Mr. Winkhorst, let's not waste time-We know that you are the chemist responsible for synthesizing the new hallucinogen drugs many of which have not yet been released even for experimental purposes-We know also that you have effected certain molecular alterations in the known hallucinogens that are being freely distributed in many quarters-Precisely how are these alterations effected? -Please do not be deterred from making a complete statement by my obvious lack of technical knowledge -That is not my job-Your answers will be recorded and turned over to the Technical Department for processing."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"The process is known as stress deformation--It is done or was done with a cyclotron-For example the mescaline molecule is exposed to cyclotron stress so that the energy field is deformed and some molecules are activated on fissionable level-Mescaline so processed will be liable to produce, in the human subject- (known as `canine preparations')-uh unpleasant and dangerous symptoms and in particular the heat syndrome ' which is a reflection of nuclear fission-Subjects complain they are on fire, confined in a suffocating furnace, white hot bees swarming in the body-The hot bees are of course the deformed mescaline molecules -I am putting it simply of course-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"There are other procedures?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Of course but always it is a question of deformation or association on a molecular level-Another procedure consists in exposing the mescaline molecule to certain virus cultures-The virus as you know is a very small particle and can be precisely associated on molecular chains-This association gives an additional tune-in with anybody who has suffered from a virus infection such as hepatitis for example-Much easier to produce the heat syndrome in such a preparation."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Can this process be reversed? That is can you decontaminate a compound once the deformation has been effected?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Not so easy-It would be simpler to recall our stock from the distributors and replace it."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"And now I would like to ask you if there could be benign associations-Could you for example associate mescaline with apomorphine on a molecular level?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"First we would have to synthesize the apomorphine formulae-As you know it is forbidden to do this."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"And for very good reason is it not, Winkhorst?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Yes-Apomorphine combats parasite invasion by stimulating the regulatory centers to normalize metabolism -A powerful variation of this drug could deactivate all verbal units and blanket the earth in silence, disconnecting the entire heat syndrome."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You could do this, Mr. Winkhorst?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"It would not be easy-certain technical details and so little time-" He held up his thumb and forefinger a quarter inch apart.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Difficult but not impossible, Mr. Winkhorst?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Of course not-If I receive the order-This is unlikely in view of certain facts known to both of us."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You refer to the scheduled nova date?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Of course."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You are convinced that this is inevitable, Mr. Winkhorst?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I have seen the formulae-I do not believe in miracles."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Of what do these formulae consist, Mr. Winkhorst?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"It is a question of disposal-What is known as Uranium and this applies to all such raw material is actually a form of excrement-The disposal problem of radioactive waste in any time universe is ultimately insoluble."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"But if we disintegrate verbal units, that is vaporize the containers, then the explosion could not take place in effect would never have existed-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Perhaps-I am a chemist not a prophet-It is considered axiomatic that the nova formulae can not be broken, that the process is irreversible once set in motion -All energy and appropriations is now being channeled into escape plans-If you are interested I am empowered to make an offer of evacuation-on a time level of course."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"And in return?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You will simply send back a report that there is no evidence of nova activity on planet earth."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"What you are offering me is a precarious aqualung existence in somebody else's stale movie-Such people made a wide U turn back to the '20s-Besides the whole thing is ridiculous-Like I send back word from Mercury: `The climate is cool and bracing--The natives are soo friendly'-or `On Uranus one is conscious of a lightness in the limbs and an exhilarating sense of freedom'-So Doctor Benway snapped, `You will simply send back spitting notice on your dirty nova activity-It is ridiculous like when the egg cracks the climate is cool and bracing’-or `Uranus is mushrooming freedom’-This is the old splintered pink carnival 1917-Sad little irrigation ditch-Where else if they have date twisting paralyzed in the blue movies?- You are offering me aqualung scraps-precarious flesh-soiled movie, rag on cock-Intestinal street boy smells through the outhouse.’ "</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I am empowered to make the offer not assess its validity."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"The offer is declined-The so-called officers on this planet have panicked and are rushing the first life boat in drag-Such behavior is unbecoming an officer and these people have been relieved of a command they evidently experienced as an intolerable burden in any case-In. all my experience as a police officer I have never seen such a downright stupid conspiracy-The nova mob operating here are stumble bums who couldn't even crash our police line-up anywhere else-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This is the old needling technique to lure a criminal out into the open-Three thousand years with the force and it still works- Winkhorst was fading out in hot spirals of the crab nebula-I experienced a moment of panic-walked slowly to the tape recorder-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Now if you would be so kind, Mr. Winkhorst, I would like you to listen to this music and give me your reaction-We are using it in a commercial on the apomorphine program-Now if you would listen to this music and give me advantage-We are thinking of sullen street boy for this spot-' I put on some Gnaova drum music and turned around both guns blazing-Silver needles under tons focus come level on average had opened up still as good as he used to be pounding stabbing to the drum beats-The scorpion controller was on screen blue eyes white hot spitting from the molten core of a planet where lead melts at noon, his body half concealed by the portico of a Mayan temple-A stink of torture chambers and burning flesh filled the room- Prisoners staked out under the white hot skies of Minraud eaten alive by metal ants-I kept distance surrounding him with pounding stabbing light blasts seventy tons to the square inch-The orders loud and clear now: "Blast-Pound-Strafe-Stab-<i>Kill</i>"-The screen opened out-I could see Mayan codices and Egyptian hieroglyphs-Prisoners screaming in the ovens broken down to insect forms-Life-sized portrait of a pantless corpse hanged to a telegraph pole ejaculating under a white hot sky-Stink of torture when the egg cracks- always to insect forms-Staked out spines gathering mushroom ants-Eyes pop out naked hanged to a telegraph pole of adolescent image-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The music shifted to Pan Pipes and I moved away to remote mountain villages where blue mist swirled through the slate houses-Place of the vine people under eternal moonlight Pressure removed-Seventy tons to the square inch suddenly moved out From a calm grey distance I saw the scorpion controller explode in the low pressure area-Great winds whipping across a black plain scattered the codices and hieroglyphs to rubbish heaps of the earth-(A Mexican boy whistling Mambo, drops his pants by a mud wall and wipes his ass with a page from the Madrid codex) Place of the dust people who live in sand storms riding the wind-<i>Wind wind wind</i> through dusty offices and archives-Wind through the board rooms and torture banks of time-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">("A great calm shrouds the green place of the vine people.")</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When I handed in my report to The District Supervisor he read it through with a narrow smile-"They have distracted you with a war film and given false information as usual-You are inexperienced of course- Totally green troops in the area-However your unauthorized action will enable us to cut some corners- Now come along and we will get the real facts-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The police patrol pounded into the home office of Lazarus &amp; Co-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"And now Mr. Winkhorst and you gentlemen of the board, let's have the real story and quickly or would you rather talk to the partisans?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You dumb hicks."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The D.S. stood there translucent silver sending a solid blast of inflexible authority.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"All right-We'll talk-The cyclotron processes image -It's the microfilm principle-smaller and smaller, more and more images in less space pounded down under the cyclotron to crystal image meal-We can take the whole fucking planet out that way up our ass in a finger stall-Image of both of us good as he used to be-A <i>stall</i> you dig-Just old showmen packing our ermines you might say-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Enough of that show-Continue please with your statement."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Sure, sure, but you see now why we had to laugh till we pissed watching those dumb rubes playing around with photomontage-Like charging a regiment of tanks with a defective slingshot."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"For the last time out of me-Continue with your statement."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Sure, sure, but you see now why we had such lookout on these dumb rubes playing around with a splintered carnival-Charging a regiment of tanks with a defective sanitarium 1917-Never could keep his gas -Just an old trouper is all"-(He goes into a song and dance routine dancing off stage-An 1890 cop picks him up in the wings and brings back a ventriloquist dummy.)</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hydraulic metal hands proffer a tray of phosphorescent meal yellow brown in color like pulverized amber -The dwarf takes out a hypo from a silver case and shoots a pinch of the meal in the main line.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Images-millions of images-That's what I eat- Cyclotron shit-Ever try kicking that habit with apomorphine ?-Now I got all the images of sex acts and torture ever took place anywhere and I can just blast it out and control you gooks right down to the molecule - I got orgasms-I got screams-I got all the images any hick poet ever shit out-My Power's coming -My Power's coming-My Power's coming-" He goes into a faith healer routine rolling his eyes and frothing at the mouth-"And I got millions and millions and millions of images of Me, Me, Me, meee." (He nods out-He snaps back into focus screaming and spitting at Uranian Willy.) "You hick-You rat-Called the fuzz on me-All right-(Nods out)-I'm finished but you're still a lousy fink-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Of course not-After giving information you will be disintoxicated."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"And the apomorphine formula, Mr. Winkhorst?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Apomorphine is no word and no image-It is of course misleading to speak of a silence virus or an apomorphine virus since apomorphine is anti-virus-The uh apomorphine preparations must be raised in a culture containing sublethal quantities of pain and pleasure cyclotron concentrates-Sub-virus stimulates antivirus special group-When immunity has been established in the surviving preparations-and many will not survive-we have the formulae necessary to defeat the virus powers-It is simply a question of putting through an inoculation program in the very limited time that remains-Word begets image and image <i>is</i> virus-Our facilities are at your disposal gentlemen and I am at your disposal- Technical sergeant I can work for anybody-These officers don't even know what button to push."

Our virus infects the human and creates our image in him.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="s1">We first took our image and put it into code. A technical code developed by the information theorists. This code was written at the molecular level to save space, when it was found that the image material was not dead matter, but exhibited the same life cycle as the virus. This virus released upon the world would infect the entire population and turn them into our replicas, it was not safe to release the virus until we could be sure that the last groups to go replica would not notice. To this end we invented variety in many forms, variety that is of information content in a molecule, which, <i>enfin</i>, is always a permutation of the existing material. Information speeded up, slowed down, permutated, changed at random by radiating the virus material with high energy rays from cyclotrons, in short we have created an infinity of variety at the information level, sufficient to keep so-called scientists busy for ever exploring the ‘richness of nature.'</span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">"It was important all this time that the possibility of a human ever conceiving of being without a body should not arise. Remember that the variety we invented was permutation of the electromagnetic structure of matter energy interactions which are not the raw material of nonbody experience.</span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"><i>Note From The Technical Department of Nova Police</i>: Winkhorst's information on the so-called "apomorphine formulae" was incomplete-He did not mention alnorphine-This substance like apomorphine is made from morphine Its action is to block morphine out of the cells-An injection of alnorphine will bring on immediate withdrawal symptoms in an addict It is also a specific in acute morphine poisoning- Doctor Isbell of Lexington states in an article recently published in <i>The British Journal of Addiction</i> that alnorphine is not habit-forming but acts even more effectively as a pain killer than morphine but can not be used because it produces "mental disturbances"-What is pain?-Obviously damage to the image-Junk is concentrated image and this accounts for its pain killing action-Nor could there be pain if there was no image-This may well account for the pain killing action of alnorphine and also for the unspecified "mental disurbances"-So we began our experiments by administering alnorphine in combination with apomorphine.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Coordinate Points</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The case I have just related will show you something of our methods and the people with whom we are called upon to deal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I doubt if any of you on this copy planet have ever seen a nova criminal-(they take considerable pains to mask their operations) and I am sure none of you have ever seen a nova police officer -When disorder on any planet reaches a certain point the regulating instance scans POLICE - otherwise - SPUT - Another planet bites the cosmic dust - I will now explain something of the mechanisms and techniques of nova which are always deliberately manipulated - I am quite well aware that no one on any planet likes to see a police officer so let me emphasize in passing that the nova police have no intention of remaining after their work is done - That is, when the danger of nova is removed from this planet we will move on to other assignments - We do our work and go-The difference between this department and the parasitic excrescence that often travels under the name `Police' can be expressed in metabolic terms: The distinction between morphine and apomorphine. `Apomorphine is made by boiling morphine with hydrochloric acid. This alters chemical formulae and physiological effects. Apomorphine has no sedative narcotic or addicting properties. It is a metabolic regulator that need not be continued when its work is done. I quote from <i>Anxiety and Its Treatment </i>by Doctor John Dent of London: `Apomorphine acts on the back brain stimulating the regulating centers in such a way as to normalize the metabolism.' It has been used in the treatment of alcoholics and drug addicts and normalizes metabolism in such a way as to remove the need for any narcotic substance. Apomorphine cuts drug lines from the brain. Poison of dead sun fading in smoke-'</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Nova Police can be compared to apomorphine, a regulating instance that need not continue and has no intention of continuing after its work is done. Any man who is doing a job is working to make himself obsolete and that goes double for police.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now look at the parasitic police of morphine. First they create a narcotic problem then they say that a permanent narcotics police is now necessary to deal with the problem of addiction. Addiction can be controlled by apomorphine and reduced to a minor health problem. The narcotics police know this and that is why they do not want to see apomorphine used in the treatment of drug addicts:</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">PLAN DRUG ADDICTION</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now you are asking me whether I want to perpetuate a narcotics problem and I say: "Protect the disease. Must be made criminal protecting society from the disease."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The problem scheduled in the United States the use of jail, former narcotics plan, addiction and crime for many years-Broad front "Care" of welfare agencies- Narcotics which antedate the use of drugs-The fact is noteworthy-48 stages-prisoner was delayed-has been separated-was required-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Addiction in some form is the basis-must be wholly addicts-Any voluntary capacity subversion of The Will Capital And Treasury Bank-Infection dedicated to traffic in exchange narcotics demonstrated a Typhoid Mary who will spread narcotics problem to the United Kingdom-Finally in view of the cure-cure of the social problem and as such dangerous to society-</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As we have seen image <i>is </i>junk-When a patient loses a leg what has been damaged?-Obviously his image of himself-So he needs a shot of cooked down image -The hallucinogen drugs shift the scanning pattern of "reality" so that we see a different "reality"-There is no true or real "reality"- “‘Reality’ is simply a more or less constant scanning pattern – The scanning pattern we accept as ‘reality’ has been imposed by the controlling power on this planet, a power primarily oriented towards total control – In order to retain control they have moved to monopolize and deactivate the hallucinogen drugs by effecting noxious alterations on a molecular level –</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p15"><span class="s1">The basic nova mechanism is very simple: Always create as many insoluble conflicts as possible and always aggravate existing conflicts-This is done by dumping life forms with incompatible conditions of existence on the same planet-There is of course nothing "wrong" about any given life form since "wrong" only has reference to conflicts with other life forms-The point is these forms should not be on the same planet-Their conditions of life are basically incompatible in present time form and it is precisely the work of the Nova Mob to see that they remain in present time form, to create and aggravate the conflicts that lead to the explosion of a planet that is to nova-At any given time recording devices fix the nature of absolute need and dictate the use of total weapons-Like this: Take two opposed pressure groups-Record the most violent and threatening statements of group one with regard to group two and play back to group two-Record the answer and take to back to group one-Back and forth between opposed pressure groups-This process is known as "feed back"-You can see it operating in any bar room quarrel-In any quarrel for that matter-Manipulated on a global scale feeds back nuclear war and nova-These conflicts are deliberately created and aggravated by nova criminals-The Nova Mob: "Sammy The Butcher," "Green Tony," "Iron Claws," "The Brown Artist," "Jacky Blue Note," "Limestone John," "Izzy The Push," "Hamburger Mary," "Paddy The Sting," "The Subliminal Kid," "The Blue Dinosaur," and "Mr. &amp; Mrs. D," also known as "Mr. Bradly Mr. Martin" also known as "The Ugly Spirit" thought to be the leader of the mob-The Nova Mob-In all my experience as a police officer I have never seen such total fear and degradation on any planet-We intend to arrest these criminals and turn them over to the biological department for the indicated alterations-</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now you may well ask whether we can straighten out this mess to the satisfaction of any life forms involved and my answer is this -Your earth case must be processed by the Biological Courts - (admittedly in a deplorable condition at this time) -No sooner set up than immediately corrupted so that they convene every day in a different location like floating dice games, constantly swept away by stampeding forms all idiotically glorifying their stupid ways of life - most of them quite unworkable of course) - attempting to seduce the judges into Venusian sex practices, drug the court officials, and intimidate the entire audience chamber with the threat of nova – In all my experience as a police officer I have never seen such total fear of the indicated alterations on any planet - a thankless job you see and we only do it so it won't have to be done some place else under even more difficult circumstances –</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p15"><span class="s1">The success of the nova mob depended on a blockade of the planet that allowed them to operate with impunity - This blockade was broken by partisan activity directed from the planet Saturn that cut the control lines of word and image laid down by the nova mob -So we moved in our agents and started to work keeping always in close touch with partisans - The selection of local personnel posed a most difficult problem - Frankly we found that most existing police agencies were hopelessly corrupt - The nova mob had seen to that - Paradoxically some of our best agents were recruited from the ranks of those who are called criminals on this planet - In many instances we had to use agents inexperienced in police work - These were of course casualties and fuck-ups - You must understand that an undercover agent witnesses the most execrable cruelties while he waits helpless to intervene, sometimes for many years, before he can make a definitive arrest - So it is no wonder that green officers occasionally slip control when they finally do move in for the arrest - This condition, known as `arrest fever,' can upset an entire operation - In one recent case, our man in Tangier suffered an attack of `arrest fever' and detained everyone on his view screen including some of our undercover men - He was transferred to paper work in another area -</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Let me explain <i>how</i> we make an arrest - nova criminals are not three-dimensional organisms - (though they are quite definite organisms as we shall see ) - but they need three-dimensional human agents to operate - The point at which the criminal controller intersects a three-dimensional human agent is known as `a coordinate point' - And if there is one thing that carries over from one human host to another and established identity of the controller it is<i> habit</i>: idiosyncracies, vices, food preferences - (we were able to trace Hamburger Mary through her fondness for peanut butter) - a gesture , a special look, that is to say the <i>style</i> of the controller - A chain smoker will always operate through chain smokers, an addict through addicts - Now a single controller can operate through thousands of human agents, but he must have a line of coordinate points - Some move on junk lines through addicts of the earth, others move on lines of certain sexual practices and so forth -It is only when we can block the controller out of all coordinate points available to him and flush him out from host cover that we can make a definitive arrest - Otherwise the criminal escapes to other coordinates –</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We picked up our first coordinate points in London.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Fade out to a shabby hotel near Earl's Court in London. One of our agents is posing as a writer. He has written a so-called pornographic novel called Naked Lunch in which The Orgasm Death Gimmick is described. That was the bait. And they walked write in. A quick knock at the door and there It was. A green boy/girl from the sewage deltas of Venus. The colorless vampire creatures from a land of grass without mirrors. The agent shuddered in a light fever. "Arrest Fever." The Green Boy mistook this emotion as a tribute to his personal attractions preened himself and strutted round the room. This organism is only dangerous when directed by The Insect Brain Of Minraud. That night the agent sent in his report:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Controller is woman-Probably Italian-Picked up a villa outside Florence-And a Broker operating in the same area-Concentrate patrols-Contact local partisans -Expect to encounter Venusian weapons-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the months that followed we turned up more and more coordinate points. We put a round-the-clock shadow on The Green Boy and traced all incoming and outgoing calls. We picked up The Broker's Other Half in Tangier.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A Broker is someone who arranges criminal jobs:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Get that writer-that scientist-this artist-He is too close-Bribe-Con-Intimidate-Take over his coordinate points-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And the Broker finds someone to do the job like: "Call `Izzy The Push,' this is a defenestration bit-Call `Green Tony,' he will fall for the sweet con-As a last resort call `Sammy The Butcher' and warm up The Ovens-This is a special case-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All Brokers have three-dimensional underworld contacts and rely on The Nova Guards to block shadows and screen their operations. But when we located The Other Half in Tangier we were able to monitor the calls that went back and forth between them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At this point we got a real break in the form of a defector from The Nova Mob: Uranian Willy The Heavy Metal Kid. Now known as "Willy The Fink" to his former associates. Willy had long been put on the "unreliable " list and marked for "Total Disposal In The Ovens." But he provided himself with a stash of apomorphine so escaped and contacted our Tangier agent. Fade out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Uranian Willy</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Uranian Willy The Heavy Metal Kid. Also known as Willy The Rat. He wised up the marks. His metal face moved in a slow smile as he heard the twittering supersonic threats through antennae embedded in his translucent skull.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Death in The Ovens."</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Trapped in this dead whistle stop, surrounded by The Nova Guard, he still gave himself better than even chance on a crash out. Electrician in gasoline crack of history. His brain seared by white hot blasts. One hope left in the universe; Plan D.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He was not out of The Security Compound by a long way but he had rubbed off the word shackles and sounded the alarm to the shattered male forces of the earth:</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Reality Film giving and buckling like a bulkhead under pressure and the pressure gauge went up and up. The needle was edging to NOVA. Minutes to go. Burnt metal smell of interplanetary war in the raw noon streets swept by screaming glass blizzards of enemy flak. He dispersed on grey sliding between light and shadow down mirror streets and shadow pools. Yes he was wising up the marks. Willy The Fink they called him among other things, syndicates of the universe feeling for him with distant fingers of murder. He stopped in for a cup of "Real English Tea Made Here" and a thin grey man sat at his table with inflexible authority.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Nova Police. Yes I think we can quash the old Nova Warrants. Work with us. We want names and coordinate points. Your application for Biologic Transfer will have to go through channels and is no concern of this department. Now we'll have a look at your room if you don't mind." They went through his photos and papers with fingers light and cold as spring wind. Grey Police of The Regulator, calm and grey with inflexible authority. Willy had worked with them before. He knew they were undercover agents working under conditions as dangerous as his own. They were dedicated men and would sacrifice him or any other agent to arrest The Nova Mob:</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As he walked past The Sargasso Café black insect flak of Minraud stabbed at his vitality centers.

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
They do not have what they call "emotion's oxygen" in the atmosphere. The medium in which animal life breathes is not in that soulless place -Yellow plains under white hot blue sky - Metal cities controlled by The Elders who are heads in bottles -Fastest brains preserved forever - Only form of immortality open to the Insect People of Minraud - An intricate bureaucracy wired to the control brains directs all movement through telepathic misdirection and camouflage -The partisans make recordings ahead in time and leave the recordings to be picked up by control stations while they are free for a few seconds to organize underground activities - Largely the underground is made up of adventurers who intend to outthink and displace the history of Minraud - Purges are constant - Fallen heads destroyed in The Ovens and replaced with others faster and sharper to evolve more total weapons - The principal weapon of Minraud is of course heat - In the centre of all their cities stand The Ovens where those who disobey the control brains are brought for total disposal - A conical structure of iridescent metal shimmering heat from the molten core of a planet where lead melts at noon - The Brass And Copper Streets surround The Over - Here the tinkers and smiths work pounding out metal rhythms as prisoners and criminals are led to Disposals - The Oven Guards are red crustacean men with eyes like the white hot sky - Through contact with oven paid and captured enemies they sometimes mutate to Beth in emotions - They often help prisoners to space and a few have escaped with the prisoners –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
(When K9 entered the apartment he felt the suffocation of Minraud crushing his chest stopping his thoughts - He turned on reserve ate dinner and carried conversation - When he left the host walked out with him down the streets of Minraud past the ovens empty and cold now - calm dry mind of the guide beside him came to the corner of 14th and Third –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
<br>
"I must go now," said the guide - "Otherwise it will be too far to go alone."<br>
He smiled and held out his hand fading in the alien air - )</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
K9 was brought to the ovens by red guards in white and gold robe of office through the Brass and Copper Street under pounding metal hammers - The oven head drying up life source as white hot metal lattice closed around him –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
"Second exposure - Time three point five," said the guard –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
K9 walked out into The Brass and Copper Streets - A slum area of vending booths and smouldering slag heaps crossed by paths worn deep in phosphorescent metal - In a square littered with black bones he encountered a group of five scorpion men - Faces of transparent pink cartilage burning inside - stinger dripping the oven poison - Their eyes flared with electric hate and they slithered forward to surround him but drew back at sight of the guard –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
They walked on into an area of tattoo booths and sex parlors - A music like wind through fine metal wires bringing a measure of relief from the terrible dry heat - Black beetle musicians saw this music out of the air swept by continual hot winds from plains that surrounded the city - The plains are dotted with villages of conical paper-thin metal houses where a patient gentle crab people live unmolested in the hottest regions of the planet –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
Controller of the Crab Nebula on a slag heap of smouldering metal under the white hot sky channels all his pain into control thinking - He is protected by heat and crab guards and the brains armed now with The Blazing Photo from Hiroshima and Nagasaki - The brains under his control are encased in a vast structure of steel and crystal spinning thought patterns that control whole galaxies thousand years ahead on the chessboard of virus screens and juxtaposition formulae –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
So the Insect People of Minraud formed an alliance with the Virus Power of the Vegetable People to occupy planet earth - The gimmick is reverse photosynthesis - The Vegetable People such up oxygen and all equivalent sustenance of animal life - Always the colorless sheets between you and what you see taste smell eat - And these green vegetable junkies slowly using up your oxygen to stay on the nod in carbon dioxide –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
When K9 entered the café he felt the colorless smell of the vegetable people closing round him taste and sharpness gone from the food people blurring in slow motion fade out - And there was a whole tank full of vegetable junkies breathing it all in - He clicked some reverse combos through the pinball machine and left the cafe - In the street citizens were yacking like supersonic dummies - The SOS addicts had sucked up all the silence in the area were now sitting around in blue blocks of heavy metal the earth's crust buckling ominously under the their weight - He shrugged: "who am I to be critical?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
He knew what it meant to kick an SOS habit: White hot agony of thawing metal - And the suffocating panic of carbon dioxide withdrawal –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
Virus defined as three-dimensional coordinate point of a controller - Transparent sheets with virus perforations like punch cards passed through the host on the soft machine feeling for a point of intersection - The virus attack is primarily directed against affective animal life - Virus of rage hate fear ugliness swirling round you waiting for a point of intersection and once in immediately perpetrates in your name some ugly noxious or disgusting act sharply photographed and recorded becomes now part of the virus sheets constantly presented and represented before your mind screen to produce more virus word and image around and around it's all around you the invisible hail of bring down word and image –</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
What does virus do wherever it can dissolve a hole and find traction? - It starts eating - And what does it do with what it eats? - It makes exact copies of itself that start eating to make more copies that start easting to make more copies that start eating and so forth to the virus power the fear heat virus slowly replaces the host with virus copies - Program empty body - A vast tapeworm of bring down word and image moving through your mind screen always at the same speed on a slow hydraulic-spine axis like the cylinder gimmick in the adding machine - How do you make someone feel stupid? - You present to him all the times he talked and acted and felt stupid against and again any number of times fed into the combo of the soft calculating machine geared to find more and more punch cards and fed in more and more images of stupidity disgust propitiation grief apathy death - The recording leave electromagnetic patterns - That is any situation that causes rage will magnetize rage patterns and draw around the rage word and image recording - Or some disgusting sex practice once the connection is made in childhood whenever the patterns are magnetized by sex desire the same word and image will be presented - And so forth - The counter move is very simple - This is machine strategy and the machine can be redirected - Record for ten minutes on a tape recorder - Now run the tape back without playing and cut in other words at random - Where you have cut in and re-recorded words are wiped off the tape and new words in their place - You have turned time back ten minutes and wiped electromagnetic word patterns off the tape and substituted other patterns - You can do the same with mind tape after working with the tape recorder - (this takes some experimentation) - The old mind tapes can be wiped clean - Magnetic word dust falling from old patterns - Word falling - Photo falling Palomar Observatories reported some answers to the riddle of exploding stars - Invariably he found the exploding star was locked by gravity to a nearby star - The two stars are in a strange symbiotic relationship - One is a small hot blue star - (Mr. Bradly) Its companion is a larger red star - (Mr. Martin) - Because the stellar twins are so close together the blue star continually pulls fuel in the form of hydrogen into an incandescent figure eight - One circle of the eight encloses one start - The other circle encloses the other - supplied with new fuel the blue star ignites." - Quote, <i>Newseek</i>, Feb. 12, 1962 –</span></p>

The Crab Nebula observed by the Chinese in 1054 A.D. is the result of a supernova or exploding star - Situated approximately three thousand light years from the earth - (Like three thousand years in hot claws at the window - You go it? -) - Before they blow up a star they have a spot picked out as many light years away as possible - Then they start draining all the fuel and charge to the new pitch and siphon themselves there right after and on their way rejoicing - You notice we don't have as much time as people had say a hundred years ago? - Take your clothes to the laundry write a letter pick up your mail at American Express and the day is gone - They are short-timing us as many light years as they can take for the getaway - It seems that there were survivors on The Crab Pitch who are not in all respects reasonable men - And The Nova Law moving fast - So they start the same old lark sucking all the charge and air and color to a new location and then? - <i>Sput</i> - You notice something is sucking all the flavor out of food the pleasure out of sex the color out of everything in sight? - Precisely creating the low pressure area that leads to nova - So they move cross the wounded galaxies always a few light years ahead of the Nova Heat - That is they did - The earth was our set - And they walked right into the antibiotic handcuffs - IT will readily be seen that having created one nova they must make other or answer for the first - I mean three thousand years in hot claws at the window like a giant crab in slag heaps of smouldering metal - Also the more novas the less time between they are running out of pitches - So they bribe the natives with a promise of transportation and immortality –</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I am having in Bill&amp;Iam," she said-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"But they don't exist-tout ça-my dear have you any idea what-certain basic flaws in the-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You can afford it-You told me hole is always there to absorb yesterday-and whatever-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"The Market you understand-Bill tossed a rock and a very dear friend of mine struck limestone with dried excrement purposes. And what purpose more has arisen -quite unlooked for-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"All the more reason to redecorate Silent Workers-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They had arrived where speech is impossible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"lam is very technical," said Bill as he walked around smoking smoke patterns in the room-"Have flash language of The Silent Ones-Out all this crap-Tonight, Madame-Age to grim Gothic Foreman-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Studio had set up a desert reek Mayan back to peasant hut-In a few minutes there mountain slope of the Andes-House had stood in the air-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Limestone country," said Bill-"We might start with a photo-collage of The House-yes?-of course and the statues in clear air fell away to a Mayan Ball Court with eternal gondolas-a terminal life form of bookies and bettors changing black berries in little jade pipes-slow ebb of limestone luck and gills-Controllers of The Ugly Spirit Spinal Fluid-hydraulic vegetable centuries-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"But what about The House Itself?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Lost their enemy-ah yes Madame, The House- You are Lady-Can't we contact them?-I mean well taken care of I hope-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I think, Bill, they exist at different pressure-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Ah yes The House-Hummm-Permutate at different pressure and sometimes a room is lost in-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Bill, they exist at different pressure-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"In the shine?-The Bensons?-But they don't exist-Tout ça c'est de l'invention-There are of course certain basic flaws in the hydraulic machinery but the marl hole is always there to absorb the uh errors-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At the bottom of the crater was a hole-Bill tossed a rock and the echo fainter and fainter as the rock struck limestone on down-Silence-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Bottomless you see for practical purposes-and what purpose more practical than disposal??"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Slow The House merged created in silent concentration of the workers from The Land Of Silence where speech is impossible-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Lucky bastards," Bill always said as he walked around smoking Havanas and directing the work in color flash language of The Silent Ones-showing his plans in photo-collage to grim Gothic foreman-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And The House moved slowly from Inca to Mayan back to peasant but in blighted maize fields or windy mountain slopes of The Andes-Gothic cathedrals soared and dissolved in air-The walls were made of blocks that shifted and permutated-cave paintings-Mayan relief-Attic frieze-panels-screens-photo-collage of The House in all periods and stages-Greek temples rose in clear air and fell to limestone huts by a black lagoon dotted with gondolas-a terminal life form of languid beautiful people smoking black berries in little jade pipes</span><span class="s3"><sup></sup></span><span class="s1">-And The Fish People with purple fungoid gills-And The Controllers drifting in translucent envelopes of spinal fluid with slow hydraulic gestures of pressure authority-These people are without weapons-so old they have lost their enemy-</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"But they are exquisite," said The Lady. "Can't we contact them?-I mean for dinner or cocktails?-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"It is not possible, Madame-They exist at different pressure-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I am having in Bill&amp;Iam"-she said during breakfast-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Her husband went pale-"My dear, have you any idea what their fee is?- "</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"That was yesterday and whatever I may have told you in times long past-The Market you understand- Something is happening to money itself-A very dear friend of mine found his <i>special </i>deposit box in Switzerland filled with uh dried excrement-In short an emergency a shocking emergency has arisen-quite unlooked -for-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"All the more reason to redecorate-There they are now- They had arrived-Bill in "banker drag he calls it now isn't that cute?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"lam is very technical"-said Bill puffing slowly on his Havana and watching smoke patterns-"Have to get some bulldozers in here-clean out all this crap-Tonight, Madame, you sleep in a tent like the Bedouin-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Studio had set up a desert on the lawn and The Family was moved out In a few hours there was only a vast excavation where The House had stood-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Limestone country," said Bill touching outcrops on walls of the crater-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"We might start with a Mayan temple-or The Greeks-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Yes of course and the statuary-City Of Marble Flesh Grafts-I envisage a Mayan Ball Court with eternal youths-and over here the limestone bookmakers and bettors changing position and pedestal- slow ebb of limestone luck-and just here the chess players-one beautiful the other ugly as The Ugly Spirit-playing for beauty-slow game of vegetable centuries-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"But what about The House itself?"-said The Lady-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Ah yes, Madame, The House-You are comfortable in your present quarters and well taken care of I hope-I think your son is very talented by the way-Hummm-perhaps-ah yes The House-Gothic Inca Greek Mayan Egyptian-and also something of the archaic limestone hut you understand the rooms and walls permutate on hydraulic hinges and jacks and sometimes a room is lost in-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"In the shuffle-The Bensons-during breakfast-"</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"A shocking emergency-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Bottomless you see for practical pee-practical disposal -There they are now-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Slow the House merged-created in drag he calls it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Isn't that cute?-Workers from The Land Of Silence whiffing slowly on his Havana and watching-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">" `Lucky Bill' always said: `Get some bulldozers in here.' "</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Family was moved and The House moved slowly-only a vast excavation in blighted maize fields and wind-Gothic cathedrals soared on walls of the crater -Blocks shifted relief and panel screens of marble flesh grafts-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I envisage stages-Gothic Cathedral soured-And over here the limestone huts by a black lagoon dotted position and pedestal-smoke chess players-and Fish People playing for beauty-slow games in their translucent envelopes-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Gestures of Pressure Author-" said The Lady-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You understand so old they are comfortable in present quarters-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"But they are exquisite"-said Tower Son-(very talented by the way for dinner or cocktails Gothic Inca Mayan Greek Egyptian-and also-)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You understand the rooms and walls-and sometimes a room is lost-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"They exist at different pressure playing their slow games by The Black Lagoon-You understand the mind works with une rapidité incroyable but the movements are very slow-So a player may see on the board great joy or a terrible fate see also the move to take or avoid see also that he can not make the move in time- This gives rise of course to great pain which they must always conceal in a round of exquisite festivals-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The lagoon now was lighted with flicker lanterns in color-floating temples pagodas pyramids-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"The festivals rotate from human sacrifice to dawn innocence when the envelope dissolves-This happens very rarely-They cultivate The Fish People like orchids or pearls-always more exquisite strains blending beauty and vileness-strains of idiot cruelty are specially prized-" He pointed to a green newt creature with purple fungoid gills that stirred in a clear pool of water under limestone outcroppings and ferns-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"This amphibious-hermaphrodite strain is motivated by torture films-So their attractions are difficult to resist -"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The green boy-girl climbed out on a ledge-A heavy narcotic effluvia drifted from his half open mouth- Her squirmed towards the controller with little chirps and giggles-The controller reached down a translucent hand felt absently into the boneless jelly caressing glands and nerve centers-The green boy-girl twisted in spasms of ingratiation-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"They are very subservient as you can see in the right hands-But we must make an excursion to the place of The Lemur People who die in captivity-They are protected-We are all protected here-Nothing really happens you understand and the human sacrifice takes a bow from the flower floats-It is all exquisite and yet would you believe me we are all intriguing to unload this gold brick on some rube for an exit visa -Oh there's my travel agent the controller engaged-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Playing their slow games by man in the black suit with long mind-works with une rapidité-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"He has been cheating me for months-slow so that a player may see believe the ridiculous travel arrange great joy and see also the move to fastest brain-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Yes we have all-Can not make the move in time-This other here-Roles must conceal in anything to go."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"If we could only just flush our flower floats on child track without a body from human sacrifice-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Rather bad taste, Old-Thing-Whose-Envelope-Has-Dissolved-The Flayed Man Stand-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"They Cultivate The Fish People-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Oh yes whose doing it?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"<i>Not </i>for more exquisite strains-??"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"I tell you nobody can scream-Over there is The Land of The Lemur People-"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"He dissolved after the performance-Beautiful strain of idiot cruelty-"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"So he got his exit visa?-and green newt creature with purple fungoid now?"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Pool of water under limestone-He has contacted someone-Know is motivated by torture films-"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Willy The Rube?-I knew him to resist-The green boy climbed hook and he fades out with Effluvia-drifted from his half open mouth all our exquisite food and smoke bones-He fade out in word giggles-He beat Green Tony into The Green Boy-Girl's Boneless Dream Concession-He defend nerve centers-The Green Boy twisted in Sammy The Butcher-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Still he may fall for The Hero-They are very subservient -"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"We are an old people you are sus-Make an excursion to the land of persona and statuary-They are protected of course-Here is he now-Really happens you understand-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I understand you people need the flower floats-It is all Mongolian Archers-They are-we are all scheming to unload an exit visa-" (The controller engaged short furtive conversation-man in a black suit with one long fingernail and gold teeth-)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"He has been cheating me for months of course they all do-You wouldn't believe the ridiculous travel arrangements they unload on our fastest brains-Yes we have all been laughing stock at one time or another- Here where roles and flesh circulate-There is no place for anything to go-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"If we could only just flush ourselves down the drain," she said seeing her life time fortunes fade on The Invisible Board-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Rather bad taste, old thing-Embalm yourself-Tonight is The Festival Of The Flayed Man-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Oh yes and whose doing it? Juanito again?-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"He dissolved after the last performance-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Oh yes he went away-And what is The Travel Agent selling you now?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"He has contacted someone known as Willy the Rube-perhaps-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Willy The Rube??-I know him from Uranus- Think you have him on the hook and he fades out with a train whistle-He beat Green Tony in a game of limestone stud and walked out with The Dream Concession-He defenestrated Izzy the Push and cowboyed Sammy The Butcher."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Still he may fall for The Hero: Protect us-We are an old people-Protect our exquisite poisonous life and our <i>statuary</i>-Well?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Here is he now."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I understand you people need protection-I am moving in a contingent of Mongolian Archers-They are expensive of course but well worth it-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Mongolian Archers with black metal flesh moved in grill arrangements of a ritual dance flexing their bows-silver antennae arrows sniffing dowsing quivering for The Enemy-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"My dear, they make me terribly nervous-Suppose there is no enemy??"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"That would be unfortunate, Madame-My archers must get relief-You did ask for protection and now-Where are the Lemur People?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Lemur People live on islands of swamp cypress peering from the branches and it took many hours to coax them down-Iridescent brown copper color- liquid black eye screens swept by virginal emotions-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"They are all affect you understand-That is why they die in captivity-" A Lemur touched The Rube's face with delicate tentative gestures and skittered again into the branches-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"No one has ever been able to hold a lemur for more than a few minutes in my memory-And it is a thousand years since anyone had intercourse with a lemur- The issue was lost-They are of such a delicacy you understand the least attempt-thought of holding or possessing and they are back in the branches where they wait the master who knew not hold and possess-They have waited a long time-Five hundred thousand years more or less I think-The scientists can never make up their mind about anything-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The lemur dropped down on Lee's shoulder and playfully nipped his ear-Other lemurs raised sails on a fragile bamboo craft and sailed away over the lagoon under the red satellite that does not change position-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"There are other islands out there where no one has ever been-The lemurs of such delicacy that they die if one sets foot on the island-They exist at different prenatal flesh in black lagoons-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You understand silver arrows sniffing pointing incroyable but the movements on The Board a terrible doom: (`Suppose there is no enemy?') Take or avoid but see also that gives rise to great pain-You did a round of exquisite festivals-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Me see your lemur people with flicker lights in swamp cypress?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Hours to coax them down-Finally the dawn innocence of control sent liquid flickering screens like pearl-All affect, you understand, that is blending beauty and flesh-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A Lemur touched Lee's face with delicate people who die in captivity-skittering again into the specially prized-this stressing they are back in who will not hold and possess-out on a ledge-a heavy narcotic indeed-thousand years more or less-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Mongolian Archers with short black conversation of ritual dancing flexed there--dowzing feeling for The Enemy like of course they all do-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You wouldn't-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"My dear, they make me terrible arrangements that have been sold to our-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"That would be unfortunate, Madame- Been laughing stock at one time or ask for protection-and now-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Tonight is the festival of Nice Young Emotions-Why they die in captivity-Juanito again?-Where is he now?-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Branches no one has ever been-He far now is-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"They are of such a hat-Is your travel agent selling you attempt or thought of holding the branches where they wait?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Perhaps-They have waited a long time-Five Uranus-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

The life form we invaded was totally alien and detestable to us-We do not have what they call `emotions’-soft spots in the host marked for invasion and manipulation-</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">So where to first year students of Biologic Law Circumstances?-Life Form A was totally alien crippled space craft-Do not have what they call "emotion's oxygen" in the atmosphere-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A student who represents Life Form A must anticipate questions of the Biologic Prosecutor:-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"How did the space craft `happen' to be crippled in such convenient proximity?-Was not the purpose of the expedition to find `oxygen' and extract it by any means?-During many years of occupancy was any effort towards biologic reconversion made by Life Form A prior to intervention of The Biologic Police? Was not Life Form A conspiring to cut off the `oxygen' of Life Form B as soon as their `travel arrangements' were completed? Did they not in fact plan to liquidate Life Form B by cutting off `emotion's oxygen' the charge on which human and other mammalian life forms run?- (Doctor W. Reich has suggested that human life is activated by units he calls `orgones' which form a belt around the planet)--Life Form A obviously conspired to blockade the orgone belt and leave Form B to suffocate in a soulless vacuum at the high surface temperatures that obtain on Life Form A’s planet of origin: 600 Degrees Fahrenheit-"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In short the plea of need offered by Life Form A is inadequate-To prepare a case would be necessary to investigate the original conditions and biologic history of Life Form A on location-A Biologic Counselor must know his client and be "trained in the body-prison contradictions of biologic law"-It will not be easy for Form A to find a counselor willing to handle "this horrible case-"</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Clearly this is a difficult case to defend particularly considering avowed intention of the accused to use the counselor as a diving suit back to their medium where counselor would be destroyed by alien conditions-There is however one phrase in the brief on which a defense can be constructed-"They sometimes mutate to breathe here"-That is if a successful mutation of Life Form A can be called in as witness- Clearly the whole defense must be based on possibility of mutation and the less said about "absolute biologic need" to maintain a detrimental parasitic existence at the total expense of Form B the better chance of a compromise verdict suspended pending mutation proceedings-</span></p>
